# delete [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/delete.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/delete)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete)

> Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i delete --save
```

## Usage

```js
var del = require('delete');

// async
del('tmp/foo.md', function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});

// sync
del.sync('tmp/foo.md');

// promise
del.promise('foo/bar/baz.txt')
  .then(function() {
    //=> do stuff
  });
```

### options.force

_(The `force` option was inspired by [grunt].)_

An error is thrown if you try to delete files outside of the current working directory (cwd).

Override the default behavior:

```js
del.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});
```
