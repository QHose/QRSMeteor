# The challenge
- Your data is on premise
- The software is in the cloud
- You want your analytics to be up to date when changes occur



# Our approach option 1- Data Access - leave the data where it is
You can choose to leave your data on premise and use *data gateway - direct access*. Now you have access without the need to open ports in your firewall
Or you can use the more traditional approach (not recommended) and open ports in your firewall and let Qlik Sense load data via a REST API as usual. 
# Our approach option 2 - Data movement - replicate the data to a cloud target
