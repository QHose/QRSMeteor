# the challenge
Your data is on premise
The software is in the cloud
# our approach option 1 - leave the data where it is
You can choose to leave your data on premise and use *data gateway - direct access*. Now you have access without the need to open ports in your firewall
Or you can use the more traditional approach and open ports in your firewall and let Qlik Sense load data via a REST API as usual. 
# our approach option 2 - replicate the data to a cloud target
