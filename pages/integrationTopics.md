# Introduction 

When embedding Qlik Sense in your platform, there are several integration topics to handle.  

# Data  
Load your data in a Qlik Sense app. The data can be a combination of different data sources. Qlik Sense has a range of connectors that allow you to analyze ALL your data in a Qlik Sense App. While loading the data, you have the possibility to create an optimized associative data model. That model is then loaded in the memory when the app opens. Next to preloading your data into an app, you can also choose to have realtime apps or specific charts which refresh based on your selections.

Depending on the location of your data, and the settings of your firewall we have multiple options to connect: US

- Security: When Qlik Sense is embedded, normally Single Sign-On must be provided for authentication. After that, authorization must be applied (What can a user see and what rights does he have?). Qlik Sense offers a flexible and robust security rule system to setup authorization. The good thing is that users, roles, groups,…. that are already defined in your SaaS platform, can be re-used in Qlik Sense.  - Web: Qlik Sense is built on the newest web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS). This allows you to create 1 app that can be easily integrated in your SaaS platform. This can be with IFrame, and using our APIs for DIV tag embedding or using Qlik Sense for the data. Qlik Sense is also completely responsive. So there is no need to create mobile content. 1 App can be used on all platforms.  - SaaS provisioning: Our APIs allow the automatic creation of customer content. Creation of Apps and streams, replacing the script with user specific script, copying apps, … can all be done automatically.  - Architecture : Our server system allows clustering, scaling and high availability.  - Dashboard: Qlik Sense offers a wide array of beautiful visualizations in order to show your data as you want it. With the open standard of Qlik Sense it is very easy to download or create additional visualizations. With our drag and drop and scalability possibilities it is very easy to create a beautiful and powerful dashboard.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12411165/227460317-4e5eeef5-aeef-4f9e-8bbe-aca049614d0d.png)
