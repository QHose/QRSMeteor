Enigma.js is an open source library, developed on GitHub. The enigma.js library helps you to communicate with the Qlik associative engine in Qlik Sense. You can use it to build your own client or to build your own Node.js service. Examples of use may be building your own browser-based analytics tools, backend services, or command-line scripts. The enigma.js library can be used as an SDK or to do CRUD (that is create, read, update and delete) operations on apps and on app entities.

# Getting started with enigma.js
The enigma.js open source repo in GitHub contains [an example for getting started](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js#getting-started) using enigma.js both inside and outside the browser. Generally speaking, using enigma.js inside the browser is similar to using it outside the browser.

You can also check out the runnable examples as well as the API documentation to help you get started.

Often, checking if users are authenticated by subscribing to the OnAuthenticationInformation message is helpful. (see subscribing to notification messages with enigma.js) .
