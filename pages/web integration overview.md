Here are some of the integration options available in Qlik Sense Cloud:

- Embedding Qlik Sense Cloud content: You can embed Qlik Sense Cloud content, such as visualizations and dashboards, directly in your web applications using the Qlik Sense Cloud API. This allows you to integrate analytics directly into your applications, providing your users with the ability to explore and analyze data within the context of your application.

- Embedding external content: You can also embed external content, such as web pages or videos, directly within Qlik Sense Cloud apps. This allows you to incorporate external data sources or multimedia content into your analytics, providing additional context and insights.

- Integration with other web services: Qlik Sense Cloud can integrate with other web services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox, allowing you to import data from these services directly into Qlik Sense Cloud apps. This allows you to easily incorporate data from external sources into your analytics.

- Single sign-on (SSO) integration: Qlik Sense Cloud supports SSO integration with external identity providers such as Okta and OneLogin, allowing users to sign in to Qlik Sense Cloud using their existing credentials or you can use JWT to connect to custom (you build your own) providers.

- Overall, Qlik Sense Cloud offers a range of web integration options that make it easy to incorporate analytics into your web applications and leverage external data sources and services.
