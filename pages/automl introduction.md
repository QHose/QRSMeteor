Qlik Application Automation isÂ a visual, no-code approach to connecting applications using actions and triggers, forming a sequence that automates a business process or data pipeline. Qlik Application Automation is part of Qlik's Active Intelligence vision.
AutoML Automated machine learning finds patterns in your data and uses them to make predictions on future data. Machine learning experiments in the Qlik Cloud hub let you collaborate with other users and integrate your predictive analytics in Qlik Sense apps. In addition to making predictions, you can do an in-depth analysis of the key features that influence the predicted outcome.

# Technical deep dive
Now we have an impression of the look and feel, lets take deeper dive...

## What are the steps to embed machine learning capabilities into your Saas platform?
- Source data from multiple sources
- Automatically profiles, indexes, and builds machine-learning ready data model across all that data
- AutoML engine automatically looks for patterns, associations, correlations across all that data, delivering rich predictions and reasons for business 
To predict outcomes
- Simple Deployment at scale into your business-critical apps and systems

## Predictive dashboard
In the end you just generate extra data (columns) with AutoML which you want to join into your existing dataset. Next you can create a dashboard as usual and just load this "extra column". Another thing you can do is to put sliders into your app an [use the real time AutoML APIs](https://community.qlik.com/t5/Design/Building-What-If-Scenarios-using-SSE-and-the-Qlik-AutoML/ba-p/1907221) to do a what if analysis.
