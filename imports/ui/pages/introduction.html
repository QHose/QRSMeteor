                    illustrate the unique selling points of our Qlik Sense APIs. Our goal is to illustrate the power of
                    Qlik Sense APIs in language that can be easily understood by non-technical business users or
                    decision-makers via our step-by-step walk-through. This learning environment was developed using our
                    experiences with AFAS, as well as other key customer accounts. We are eager to explain, excite and
                    reassure senior executives and management about the Qlik platform by modeling its ease of use and
                    full automation capabilities.</p>
                <p>Our presentation to the right precedes our full demonstration environment experience, aiming to
                    bridge any knowledge gaps for our non-technical prospects while providing a clear and simple pathway
                    towards understanding how to embed Qlik Sense in a multi-tenant SaaS application platform. A key
                    outcome for using this demonstration asset is to mitigate potential risk early in the sales cycle,
                    build enthusiasm/interest for Qlik Sense and its capabilities, and showcase our readiness to support
                    the customer or partner’s vision for embedding analytics within their application suite.</p>
                <p>This prospect experience is supported by several linked assets. We have a demo website which
                    simulates the SaaS platform of an OEM partner, including videos and documentation illustrating each
                    integration topic and a presentation taking the audience through a journey which highlights key
                    aspects of Qlik Sense, its APIs and the overall value of Qlik.</p>

                    In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>The left side shows "the broker" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use
                        today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its
                        activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template
                        apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                    <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams
                        automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                </ul>
                In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which
                        customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the
                        customers. By pressing the button, you also select an "app" to be used as a template for the
                        layout.</li>
                    <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It
                        replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are
                        able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and
                        tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we
                        make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                    <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and
                        make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test
                        row level security by opening the "row level security" app in the "everyone stream". This
                        demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group
                        membership.</li>

                    options.</p>
                <p>You can integrate the hub, an app, a sheet or individual charts. In most cases you have the

                        <p>Your goal is to create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment - embedded analytics -
                            within your core application(s) where each of your customers would see and use only their
                            data. It’s possible for each customer to have a more fine grained authorization structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>As an example, it is possible to provide authorizations for a specific department or country
                            within a dashboard. Ultimately you will see a simple solution in our demonstration in which
                            both of our fictitious users, Peter and John, go to the same website, but see different
                            things based on their authorizations. Qlik Sense makes this possible because it uses a
                            dynamic attribute-based security approach in which we re-use all the pre-existing users and
                            roles from your SaaS platform. This ensures Qlik Sense stays automatically in synch and
                            avoids the overhead of double maintenance.

                the users. We will insert a little piece of code inside your existing "security module". In this module
                you already know who the user is (authentication) and what his rights are (authorization). The only
                thing we need to do is create a trust relationship between your server and the new Qlik Sense server
                (via a SSL certificate exchange). And send this info about the user (userId, group membership) in a JSON
                object to Sense (we call this ticketing).
                <h4 class="ui header">Authorization</h4> Based on the userId and group membership streams (a way to
                group apps, like HR/Finance), apps, sheets (all called "resources" in our rule based security model) are
                shown or not. Let's say we start simple and each customer can only view their own dashboards. Since we
                gave each customer its own stream we can grant access if the name of the stream (your company name)
                equals the the name of the company we received from your website in the ticket. We can all control this
                by adding 1 row of security configuraton: User.group = Stream.name.
