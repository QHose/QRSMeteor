            We have now finished creating the content per customer. So a good time
            to look at how Qlik can re-use your SaaS platforms authorizations and
            implement single sign on. On this page you will see a dropdown, this
            dropdown contains the users of your SaaS platform. Using this dropdown
            we can simulate a user login (without having to insert passwords etc.).
            In this way you can easily test the single sign on process, and make
            sure your platform is in the lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you select a user a ticket will be requested which inludes your SaaS
            platform's current authorizations (the groups) in a dynamic way. This
            means you don't have to create users and roles up front in Qlik Sense.

              >QMC security rules</a
            >
            are also created in a dynamic way, so we can protect the apps and
            streams with a couple of generic rules. The row/column level security is
            done via a special section in the script of an app (QVF). In this demo
            we used the group (Country) to ensure each user only sees his country in
            the "row level security app" in the " everyone stream.
