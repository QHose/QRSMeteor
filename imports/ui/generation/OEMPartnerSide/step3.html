            Step 3: Start provisioning Qlik Sense apps
        </h4>
        <p>
            This demo step shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a "template layout" for each of your
            customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.</p>
        <p>The following apps
        <ul>
            {{#each templateApps}}
            <li>
                {{name}}
            </li>
            {{/each}}
        </ul>
        will be "provided" to customers :
        <ul>
            {{#each customers}}
            <li>
                {{name}}
            </li>
            {{/each}}
        </ul>
        </p>

                <p>This demo platform provides you with a wrapper around the Qlik Sense <a
                        href="https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/3.1/Content/Videos/Videos-qmc-intro.htm">QMC</a>. This
                    means you
                    can execute activities (like pressing buttons) in this demo platform, and in the end they will be
                    executed
                    remotely in Qlik Sense (via API calls).</p>
                <p>
                    Using these calls you can, for example, create streams and apps or complete any other activity that
                    youâ€™d be
                    able to do in the QMC or app. Each activity you do is <a href="{{pathFor 'ApiLogsTable'}}"
                        class="item">logged</a>. In these logs you can see the request from this demo platform and the
                    responses
                    from Qlik Sense. </p>
                <p>
                    Why do you have to select a customer first? Well, in your SaaS platform you probably want to publish
                    the
                    apps only for customers who pay or who have activited the app in your software, so this "selection"
                    simulates that use case.
