            Step 3: Start provisioning Qlik Sense apps
        </div>
        <p>
            This demo step shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a "template layout" for each of your customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.</p>
        <p>The following apps
            <ul>
                {{#each templateApps}}
                    <li>
                        {{name}}
                    </li>
                {{/each}}
            </ul>
            will be "provided" to customers :
            <ul>
                {{#each customers}}
                    <li>
                        {{name}}
                    </li>
                {{/each}}
            </ul>
        </p>

                <h4>Manual activities</h4>
                <p>This demo platform provides you with a wrapper around the Qlik Sense <a href="https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/3.1/Content/Videos/Videos-qmc-intro.htm">QMC</a>. This means you can execute activities (like pressing buttons) in this demo platform, and in the end they will be executed remotely in Qlik Sense (via API calls).</p>
                <p>                    
                    Using these calls you can, for example, create streams and apps or complete any other activity that you’d be able to do in the QMC or app. Each activity you do is <a href="{{pathFor 'ApiLogsTable'}}" class="item">logged</a>. In these logs you can see the request from this demo platform and the responses from Qlik Sense. </p>
                    <p>
                    Why do you have to select a customer first? Well, in your SaaS platform you probably want to publish the apps only for customers who pay or who have activited the app in your software, so this "selection" simulates that use case.
