Click on the link to see our self-service demo. With our governed self-service you have the possibility to define how to implement guided self-service. By creating roles or groups we have created different levels of self service on Qlik Sense.
 - A consumer can only analyze data.
 - A contributor can create own private sheets.
 - A developer has the possibility to create its own sheets and apps.
 - An admin can maintain the content of its department through the Qlik Management Console (QMC).

By using row level security each user can only see the data it has access to.
In the example here, John can only see data from Germany and Linda can only see data from the USA while Martin can see all the data.",,,,,,,,,

In the end you want to provide an integrated page of Qlik Sense in your software. The user should be able to access only his correct data in a seamless way. The customer should not authenticate again. Whenever he is authenticated in your software, the Qlik Sense content should be shown seamlessly. You also want to make sure that the right Qlik Sense content is shown in an automated way with a minimum of manual creation.",,,,,,,,,

APIs are our secret sauce so this website is specifically designed to illustrate the unique selling points of our Qlik Sense APIs. Our goal is to illustrate the power of Qlik Sense APIs in language that can be easily understood by non-technical business users or decision-makers via our step-by-step walk-through. This learning environment was developed using our experiences with AFAS, as well as other key customer accounts. We are eager to explain, excite and reassure senior executives and management about the Qlik platform by modeling its ease of use and full automation capabilities.

Our presentation precedes our full demonstration environment experience, aiming to bridge any knowledge gaps for our non-technical prospects while providing a clear and simple pathway towards understanding how to embed Qlik Sense in a multi-tenant SaaS application platform. A key outcome for using this demonstration asset is to mitigate potential risk early in the sales cycle, build enthusiasm/interest for Qlik Sense and its capabilities, and showcase our readiness to support the customer or partner’s vision for embedding analytics within their application suite.

This prospect experience is supported by several linked assets. We have a demo website which simulates the SaaS platform of an OEM partner, including videos and documentation illustrating each integration topic and a presentation taking the audience through a journey which highlights key aspects of Qlik Sense, its APIs and the overall value of Qlik.",,,,,,,,,

When embedding Qlik Sense in your platform, there are several integration topics to handle:
 - Data: Load your data in a Qlik Sense app. The data can be a combination of different data sources. Qlik Sense has a range of connectors that allow you to analyze ALL your data in a Qlik Sense App. While loading the data, you have the possibility to create an optimized associative data model. That model is then loaded in the memory when the app opens. With direct discovery you can also your real time SQL queries. Also incremental or delta loads are possible in order to reduce the reload time.
 - Security: When Qlik Sense is embedded, normally Single Sign-On must be provided for authentication. After that, authorization must be applied (What can a user see and what rights does he have?). Qlik Sense offers a flexible and robust security rule system to setup authorization. The good thing is that users, roles, groups,…. that are already defined in your SaaS platform, can be re-used in Qlik Sense.
 - Web: Qlik Sense is built on the newest web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS). This allows you to create 1 app that can be easily integrated in your SaaS platform. This can be with IFrame, and using our APIs for DIV tag embedding or using Qlik Sense for the data. Qlik Sense is also completely responsive. So there is no need to create mobile content. 1 App can be used on all platforms.
 - SaaS provisioning: Our APIs allow the automatic creation of customer content. Creation of Apps and streams, replacing the script with user specific script, copying apps, … can all be done automatically.
 - Architecture : Our server system allows clustering, scaling and high availability.
 - Dashboard: Qlik Sense offers a wide array of beautiful visualizations in order to show your data as you want it. With the open standard of Qlik Sense it is very easy to download or create additional visualizations. With our drag and drop and scalability possibilities it is very easy to create a beautiful and powerful dashboard.",,,,,,,,,

The left side of the screen will show the 'broker'. This is a software capability that is already in place and manages the current SaaS platform. This piece of software will maintain the control of the SaaS platform and will communicate with our Sense platform through our APIs. This means that the control stays completely in the existing platform.

In this demo, the broker will define following parameters:
 - Which customers need access to the applications?
 - What will be the roles and the access rights to the apps?
 - Which apps should be provided?

On the right side of the screen, the result of the activities of the broker will be shown:
 - Which streams were created.
Which apps were copied and published.",,,,,,,,,

<p> This demo shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a ""template layout"" for each of your customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.

 In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The left side shows ""the broker"" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                            <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button, you also select an ""app"" to be used as a template for the layout.</li>
         <li><b>Select your apps</b> Which apps do your customers need to receive?</li>
                            <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                            <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the ""row level security"" app in the ""everyone stream"". This demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group membership.</li>
                        </ol> </p>",,,,,,,,,

A user can be a computer or a human. What defines a user is the fact that it has a userID, that it belongs to a certain customer and that it has one or multiple groups. When that user logs on to the SaaS platform, he is authenticated.  At the point he needs to see Qlik Sense content, that user needs to be authenticated with Qlik Sense. At this point this information is passed through by means of a ticket. (There are other methods, but here we use ticketing). This ticket contains the userID and additional attributes ( like groups, specific script content,….). On this website thery are stored in a Mongo Database. Through APIs these can be fetched and passed to Qlik Sense. Based on the userID and group(s) the correct content will be shown and the user will have the correct rights based on the group membership.",,,,,,,,,

This slide shows the process of an app generation when a user logs in to the SaaS platform:
 - A user logs in on the SaaS platform.
 - In the SaaS platform a user is automatically connected to the Qlik Sense Hub, embedded in the SaaS platform via an IFrame or a DIV tag integration.
 - Through Single Sign On, the user will be automatically connected to the Qlik Sense platform . This is done through ticketing. The ticket contains the userID and the group(s) of the user. 
Based on this information and through APIs, the correct apps and streams will be created in Qlik Sense and be provisioned to the user. ",,,,,,,,,

Integration.qlik.com has 3 servers running:
 - QRSMeteor server: This server runs on port 3000. This server hosts the admin panel that acts as the broker. Through this server the administration of the SaaS platform is being managed. (Adding customers and users, which apps should be provisioned,…)
 - Sense web integration: This server runs on port 3030. This is a webserver in where we are embedding our Qlik Sense environment.
 - Qlik Sense server: This server runs on port 443. This server contains all the Qlik Sense content that needs to be provisioned. (apps, app objects, streams). This server interacts with the 2 other servers. It interacts  with the QRS meteor server trough API calls. The QRS meteor server will send these calls in order to copy, reload and publish apps, create streams,…
It also interacts with the Sense web integration. The user needs to see its embedded content in the SaaS environment, through IFrame or DIV tag integration. Through Single Sign On the correct content will be shown.",,,,,,,,,

You’ll see a simple solution in our demonstration where both of our fictitious users, Peter and John, go to the same website, but see different things based on their authorizations. Qlik Sense makes this possible because it uses a dynamic, attribute-based security approach in which we re-use all the pre-existing users and roles from your SaaS platform.

#Some basic principles in setting up SaaS provisioning with Qlik Sense:
 - Create 1 or multiple template apps per business or process area. This way the different apps are easy maintainable and grouped. Also administrator(s) per area can maintain their specific content. A template app contains about 80% of all layout, sheets and charts.
 - Apps can be manually created through the Qlik Sense Hub or through an API call. (Our APIs work all with a JSON structure).
 - When the template app will be copied to make the customer specific one, the customer specific data must be loaded in the app. A modification must be made to the script to made it customer specific. Most of the time only the database connection must be changed  as most of the customers will have the same structure in tables and fields. All this customer specific data is already stored in a database.
 - The modification of the script can be done through APIs. 
There is also a possibility of using and INCLUDE file: This is an external file that contains customer specific script.

# To summarize:  
In the end you want that all your customers will get their own app with their own data.
For this we use a piece of software that regulates your SaaS platform, or a broker. On the Qlik Sense server we have already our template apps. These are apps that already have a script, data model and layout ready. Whenever we need to provision an app the following steps happen: 
 - A stream is created with the name of the customer.
 - A copy of the template app will be made with the name of the customer.
 - Some script is inserted or modified to make sure the correct data is loaded.
 - The app is reloaded,
 - The app gets published in the correct stream.

With Qlik Sense you have the possibility to embed our hub, sheet, charts or use just the data.

# The technology used
One of the biggest advantages of Qlik Sense is the fact that an app can be used for all devices. Qlik Sense uses and supports a range of modern technologies:
- HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript: These technologies are used to embed Qlik Sense in a web environment. The HTML will define the frame of the webpage, CSS will style the page while JavaScript will take care of the behavior.
- RequireJS, AngularJS: These frameworks are being used by Qlik Sense and can be easily reused in the web environment.
- JSON is the language being used to communicate with our engine and other services.
- The way Qlik Sense communicates with its own and other services is done through the WebSocket protocol.
- CANVAS is being used to create visualizations.
- Websockets are used for the connection between the client and the Qlik server.",,,,,,,,,

There are a couple of options for embedding. It depends on your requirements which one is the best option for you. Do you want to re-use what Qlik created for you or do you want to have full control over the look and feel? If you re-use our client you can be sure you will have a quick implementation but you have less customization flexibility. If you only use our charts you will have to create the website and buttons and other navigation aspects yourself and you will loose capabilities which are only available in the Qlik Sense client (out of the box) like the self service client, bookmarks and story telling. Note that you can build most features also yourself if you use our [APIs](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/September2017/Content/APIs-and-SDKs.htm). 
 
# IFrame
A very easy method of embedding the Hub, App, Sheet or an object. Basically with an IFrame you embed another document in the current HTML document. You can embed a maximum of 3 iframes in your DOM.
## When to use?
- Speed of deployment is key. 
- The look and feel of Qlik Sense suits your needs. Note that you can always change most layout aspects using Qlik Sense [theming API](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/February2018/Subsystems/APIs/Content/CapabilityAPIs/ThemeAPI/ThemeAPI.htm). 
- In this way you can embed our complete (self service) client. 
- If you require more customization you can better look at the options below. Please prevent that you start modifying our standard client files, you will face the risk of support and upgrade challenges. 

# Div Tag:
An HTML page can have reserved spaces (or placeholders). These are defined with Div tags. With our Capability API's it is possible to put Qlik Sense objects (individual charts) in these Div tags.
## When to use?
- You have a read only scenario (no self service) and you want to embed Qlik Sense in an existing web page. You will have to create the buttons and all other aspects yourself using the client side APIs.

# On the fly
Instead of already creating an object in a Qlik Sense app and then using it in a HTML page, it is possible to create the object on the fly in the JavaScript of the web page. Through our visualization API we give you the possibility to generate charts or other objects on the fly. This gives you the possibility to only generate the charts or complete apps whenever a user logs in, giving you lots of flexibility.
## When to use?
- You don't want to create or load data up front in an app. Based on selections in your host applications you want to create a chart or app on the fly.

# Data only
You can also just take the data out of Qlik Sense and build your own front-end. You can use the Capabilities API or the Engine API directly to get an array of data and vizualize it using your own charting library, Qlik Sense [picasso.js](https://picassojs.com/examples.html) or any other. Note that the [https://integration.qlik.com](integration.qlik.com) site is build in this way...
## When to use?
- You want to use your own vizualizations and have full control over the HTML, javascript (enigmaJS) and CSS. Or you like to use Qlik Sense data but you don't have javascript. Since the Engine API is JSON RPC you can connect to it using any language. 
- You have a read only scenario and don't need to use the self service client. Or you are willing to create this functionality using the APIs.",,,,,,,,,

In our  'Embedding Qlik Sense' demo we have embedded  different parts of Qlik Sense.
On the left side of the screen you can choose which example you want to see. On the right side you will see the result.
Basically there are 3 main ways of embedding Qlik Sense:
 - Through an IFrame: This method allows to embed the full hub, a complete app, a complete sheets or a collection of multiple objects. It allows Qlik Sense to be embedded is a fast and easy way. When using IFrame you are using the layout and objects defined in Qlik Sense. Note that you can change the colors and fonts using ""themes"".
 - With Div tags you have the possibility to embed individual Qlik Sense objects like charts in a web page.  A Div tag is nothing more than a reserved place on a webpage. This allows you to make a customized webpage in which you can have your own layout and functionality.
- Finally you can use Qlik Sense APIs to get the data to be used by your own vizalization library. The JavaScript charts can be built on the fly through our APIs or via external visualizations libraries(Eg. D3 charts)",,,,,,,,,

# An overview of the key APIs
 - Re-use: If you want to reuse Qlik Sense components in your website. This can be the hub, an app, a sheet or objects. For this DIV tags or IFrame are used.
 - On the fly: This means that apps, data or objects are only created or provisioned whenever a customer logs in. This can be from creating an app on demand, only load in customer specific data, to creating a chart on the fly using HTML or JavaScript code.
 - Extend: With our collection of APIs you can make chart types that were not out of the box available, but act as native Qlik Sense objects. You can also add widgets to improve the look and feel of you Qlik Sense application. On [branch.qlik.com]\(qlik.branch.com) you can find a collection of third party extensions, free for download or you can add your own extensions there.
 - Data only: Instead of using Qlik Sense with its visual layer, only the  fast in-memory data warehouse of Qlik is used. Through API calls in JSON format you can create your own visual layer by using Qlik Sense as your backbone for data delivery and data associations.",,,,,,,,,

 - On the SaaS platform you have the webpage, consisting out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the HTML, the IFrame refers to a URL of Qlik Sense.
 - At the point that the HTML page is loaded, connection to the Qlik Sense server is needed. To get access to the server, the virtual proxy must be passed first (authenticating).
On the bottom of the screen there are 2 examples of IFrame URLs. The first one shows a sheet in an analysis state. The second one shows a sheet where a certain selection has been made.",,,,,,,,,

# Pro and con
## Pro
 - It is very easy to embed content in a page. There is no need of knowing specific or difficult HTML statements.
 - It is very simple to separate content onto several pages. A part of the page can stay static while other content can be dynamic
 - There is no collision between layout, CSS styles as it is a separate website.
## Cons
 - You do not have a single HTML page and the IFrame integrates another one in the current HTML page. So at least 2 of them need to be maintained, and code is separated. 
 - Sizing an IFrame is considerably more work.
 - Broken framesets might be an issue.

Qlik Sense capabilities APIs are a collection of JavaScript APIs that allows you to easily embed Qlik Sense content in a web page.
Our capability APIs are dependent on AngularJS and RequireJS. When integrating our APIs in an existing project, the same libraries must be used.
With our capability APIs existing visualizations of Qlik Sense can be used or created on the fly and can be embedded in a web page. But it goes further: Data, selections, bookmarks, variables,…. Can all be obtained and used.

This slide shows the JavaScript example of using our capability APIs for integrating Qlik Sense objects into a webpage through Div tags.

First the Qlik Sense app needs to be opened to get to the content and objects that need to be embedded. This happens on the line of code that starts with 'var app':
The API qlik.openApp is used to create an object that gets access to the desired app.
The long number is the internal GUID of the app that is used in our Qlik Sense environment. The config object is used to make sure the right connection is made with the Qlik Sense Server.

Secondly there are 2 lines that start with 'app.getObject':
This API gets the GUID of the object ( the second parameter) and puts it in the desired placeholder (first parameter). These placeholders are defined in the HTML code of the web page with Div tags.

This code gives an example by using an API to make a selection in a certain field.In this case _app.field(fieldname).selectvalues([values])_
Is used. The field 'LastName' is used here and the value 'Jones' will be selected from it.

#This slide gives an overview which steps are executed to use our Capabilities API.  
1. The user is authenticated in the SaaS platform and arrives on a web page with embedded Qlik Sense objects through our Capabilities API in the JavaScript. 
2. In order to show the Qlik Sense content, the user must be authenticated in the Qlik Sense system. So first of all there has to be an authentication check through a Qlik Sense virtual proxy. (Most of the time this is done through ticketing). If the user fails the authentication check, a WebSocket error will occur. 
3. If the authentication was successful, the Require.JS starts. This is a module loader that loads in all the required components in the right order to make sure the Qlik Sense objects can be loaded. These components are Qlik.js, the client-CSS and fonts. 
4. When these are loaded, it is important that the right objects are shown. First authorizing happens. This is done by our security rules. If a certain user does not have access to a certain app or object the Qlik Sense content will not be shown in the embedded HTML page.
Finally Section Access is used to make sure row level security is executed.",,,,,,,,,

The Host white list is a property on the Qlik Sense virtual proxies. In there the hostnames, IP addresses or subdomains of the servers where Qlik Sense needs to connect to, can be entered.
Now in an integration example:  
First you have the webpages of the SaaS platform which contain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTTP origin header comes from the SaaS platform web server. Whenever Qlik Sense is embedded though IFrame or Div tags , it also uses web content which again uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But here the HTTP origin header comes from Qlik Sense.
Whenever the page on the SaaS platform is loaded, it will need the embedded content from Qlik Sense. To get to the content you always need to pass the Qlik Sense virtual proxy. If the virtual proxy does not know the address, hostname,… of the server then there will no WebSocket connection allowed. The page will not load in the Qlik Sense content.  
When an additional header is supplied, the address needs not to be added to the whitelist : Access-Control-Allow-Origin *. Instead of using *, use your protocol, server, port combination.

JavaScript is a vast collection of different libraries and frameworks, each with their own set of requirements.
Require.js is a framework that loads in the required pieces of software (called packages or modules) in the correct order as certain frameworks are dependent of others. Qlik Sense uses a modified version Require.js. Certain pieces of code have been added to make sure all our APIs work properly.
(At the beginning of the JavaScript code of a mashup, you will always see the following line: _require( [""js/qlik""], function ( qlik )_. This is the call for the Qlik required framework).   
This modified version of Qlik is not the same as the default require.js. In order to make sure Qlik Sense works properly, your web platform MUST use the same version of require.js as the version that ships with Qlik Sense. If not the mashup will fail to work.

This code shows 2 ways of creating Qlik Sense visualizations on the fly:
 - Through our APIs _app.visualization.create_:   This API will make a Qlik Sense visualization. The first parameter defines it is going to be a bar chart. The second parameters contains the Dimension(s) ( in this case 'Country)' and Measure(s) ( in this case '=sum(LineSalesAmount)'for the bar chart.   After the creation, the bar chart is shown in the designated Div placeholder.
 - Through visuals web components: This way there is no need for JavaScript. First the correct app is opened.  After that the type of the chart is chosen (here a barchart).
Finally the columns are defined: '[Case Owner Group]' as dimension and '=Avg([Case Duration Time])' as measure.  
The chart gets the title: 'on the fly barchart'.",,,,,,,,,

This method is used whenever a user or company wants to maintain their own look and feel/house style (colors, fonts, specific customized visualizations,…) or the user has already a full library of its own visualizations and wants to use those.  
As said on the previous slide, it gives the users the possibility to create their own visual layer while maintaining the associative power of Qlik Sense. This means that ALL the data will be completely visual at ALL times. Through the communication of the SaaS platform and Qlik Sense through WebSockets, your data keeps in sync. Selections can be made as in a native Qlik Sense visualization. As the data is connected, all the other visualizations or object will react to the selections.

With the Table API it is possible to retrieve any combination of dimensions and measures. In the code, first the correct app is opened to have access to the dataset. After that the _app.createTable_ API is used to create the data table on the fly. In this example the table has 2 dimensions: 'Country' and 'City' and 1 measure : 'Sum(LineSalesAmount)'. The rows parameter defines the maximum rows of the table.

This slide explain the difference between the Qlik Analytics Platform and Qlik Sense Enterprise. Basically the QAP is Qlik Sense Enterprise without the hub. This means that with the QAP you cannot create and edit apps, see an app overview,… through the hub. All these actions are available through our APIs.

So if the function that you shared is called every time they flip between the panels in the end you will have a lot of active visualization models.

Which all will react to every selection you make in the app and start fetching data even though they aren't rendering anything to the screen.

That's usually the main culprit when people experience that the app gets slow over time. (Source: Alexander Karlsson)",,,,,,,,,

First of all it is really important to understand the difference between authentication and authorization. Let's use the following example:   You arrive at work and you start up your computer. Before you can use it, you need to give in a username and password. That process is called authenticating. By entering your unique user and password the computer knows who you are, and lets you enter. Authenticating is used constantly: unlocking your smartphone, logging on to your amazon account,…. Authentication is like asking: 'Who are you?' and is often the first step in a security model.  
Let's go back to the example of logging on to your work computer. After you are logged in you need certain files of your department to work in. You go to the place where they are stored and get the required files. You notice that you can only see and modify the files of YOUR department, not of the other departments. This is called authorizing.  
Authorization is asking: 'I know who you are, now what can you do?'.",,,,,,,,,

Qlik Sense is built from the ground up to be flexible. This means that Qlik Sense can be implemented in every type of company (small, medium or large). This is possible because Qlik Sense works with security rules that can be fully modified in order to be implemented in any company structure.",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense, the control is fully kept. Typical problems like unreliable and slow reporting, different versions of the truth, performance issues ,… are handled with Qlik Sense:  
Qlik Sense security is so flexible it can completely plugin in the existing security framework. In addition with our Security rules and row level security (Section Access) we can give the right content to the right users and developers. Every user will have its correct rights. That means that end users will only be able to analyse, but developers can maintain their apps real-time, so that modifications can be done very fast. So it's always necessary to make sure there is an authorization concept design made.

This slide gives an example of an authorization concept. It's a combination of certain rules a certain user or group can execute. Qlik Sense is completely free and flexible to create security rules, so an initial design is strongly advised in order to build up a robust and easy security authorization system.

The next step after the functional design of the authorization, is the technical design. As Qlik Sense needs to plugin into an existing system, there are some key questions:
 - Where are the users stored? As we use the users that are already present in the current system.
 - Can existing groups be re-used outside of Qlik? These groups will be used in security rules to define what the self-service rights, roles,… can be. 
 - If the groups cannot be re-used, is it possible to create and assign groups or roles in Qlik Sense.",,,,,,,,,

The user's identity can be stored in a different set of systems. Traditionally users are stored in Active Directory or LDAP. (Qlik Sense supports Active directory out of the box). Users can also be store in other software systems like Facebook, Salesforce, HR systems,… It is also possible to store the data of the users in a traditional database or filetype (like Excel). For SaaS - OEM scenarios, the option to store the users in a database is preferred. It makes it very easy to inject that data into a ticket that can be passed on to our Qlik Sense system.

"Security - technical design","Qlik Sense options to authenticate","!comment
Qlik Sense has different options for authentication. You can create as many virtual proxies as you want, each with their own specific method of authenticating. The following authentication methods are supported:
 - Microsoft authentication (Local Windows directory or Active directory). This is one of the most common methods to authenticate. For Qlik Sense it is also the easiest: When a Qlik Sense Enterprise is installed, it authenticates by default against AD.
 - Ticketing. This method is used a lot in integration and SSO (Single Sign On) scenarios. A user is already authenticated in another software, but needs to see embedded Qlik Sense content. A ticket is passed to the virtual proxy of Qlik Sense. The ticket contains all the necessary information of the user ( ID, name, group,…)
 - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). Also used for SSO. It is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider.
 - Headers. This method is used for SSO and integration scenarios. The ID and additional information of the user is parsed in the HTTP(S) header.
 - JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for secure transmission of information between two parties as a JavaScript Object Notation or JSON object. JWT is used for authentication and authorization. Because JWT enables single sign-on (SSO), it minimizes the number of times a user has to log on to cloud applications and websites.  
Certificates are used for communication between different servers so that it is completely secured.",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense you do not need different machines with different proxies with authentication methods. In Qlik Sense, virtual proxies are created that all can run on the same machine. Each virtual proxy has its own authentication method and is linked to a proxy. 
Whenever a user needs data form Qlik Sense in an embedded environment, our API includes the name or prefix of which virtual proxy needs to be used and is redirected to a specific proxy path.",,,,,,,,,

Authorization in Qlik Sense is mainly handled by the security rules. These security rules are very customizable and flexible. In order to make a robust security rule set, it is important to know some relevant resources. 
- Context: A rule can be made in a certain context. There are 3 contexts available: Hub, QMC or Both. Context is a way to split the rules between the QMC (Management Console) or The Qlik Sense Hub. Some resources can exist in the 2 resources (For example Apps, Streams, App Objects). Then you use the 'Both' option on the resource.
- Stream: A stream can be compared to a folder. A stream will contain 1 or multiple apps. In order to present Qlik Sense apps to end users, the apps must be put in a stream. That process is called publishing an app. If an app is not published, it will appear in the 'My Work' stream of the owner and it will only be available to the owner.
 - App: An app consists out of multiple app objects : sheets, stories, bookmarks, dimensions, measures. On the sheets multiple objects can be placed (Charts, tables, KPI objects,…) to show the data.",,,,,,,,,

"Security - technical design","Security flow: User opens an app","!comment
When a user wants to display an embedded app in his web environment, a whole process is started to make sure the user sees the correct content.  
The first step is the authentication part:  
A connection to a virtual proxy of Qlik Sense is made. There are different methods of authentication (Windows, Ticket, header, SAML, JWT).  

When the user is authenticated the second step starts: authorization.  
This is handled mainly by the security rules of Qlik Sense. The levels that are being checked are:  
Does the user have stream access? If yes, does he have access to the app in the stream? If yes does he have app object access? (stream, story, bookmark). 
If these requirements are met, the last part of authorization comes into play. The row level security or section access is defined in the data load editor of the app. When the app is opened the section access will activate and show only the right data subset in the app.

The user logs in and goes to our server or the Qlik Sense hub. First of all the user must be known, so authentication must be done. This is done by our Qlik Sense Proxy (QPS). Then the user gets authenticated. If there is no cookie present yet, the proxy redirects the request to an authentication module. It will request a ticket for the user and group membership. In order to get the required data, there is a UDC (User Directory Connector) used. A UDC creates a link to the database of the identity provider to be able to get the required user data. When this is done, the user is redirected to the hub, with a ticket appended in the URL of the request. The proxy will grant access. After that the correct content will be shown through our security rules. And finally , to see the correct data in an app, section access is executed.

This slide gives an overview of all the security processes when opening an app.
- The user starts from the browser and needs to see Qlik Sense content.
- First of all the Qlik Proxy Services (QPS) will need the user credentials to grant access. A connection to the Identity Provider will be made to verify this. By default Qlik Sense will authenticate against Active Directory, but other authentication methods are possible. When the user credentials are correct, the proxy will create a session. This whole process is the authentication part of Qlik Sense. 
- After that, the right content must be shown. This is handled by the security rules in Qlik Sense. To make sure that Qlik Sense knows the IDs and attributes of the users, UDC(s) (User Directory Connector) are created to make sure that this information is known in Qlik Sense. The security rules, UDC's and user data are stored in the Repository Database of Qlik Sense. That database is maintained by the Qlik Repository Services (QRS). This is the first step of authorization. 
- Now the correct content is available for the user. To make sure that the app shows the correct sub data set, Dynamic data reduction or Section Access is used. This is a specific script that is made in the app itself. It is executed when the app is opened. The Qlik Engine Service (QES) is the service that hosts the apps so it also executes the Section Access. This is the second part of authorization.",,,,,,,,,

To pass through the user information from the SaaS platform to Qlik Sense, often ticketing is used.
- A user logs in to the SaaS platform. At this point the user is authenticated in the SaaS platform. It is important to know that Qlik Sense will not store the list of users again. All the users and authorizations are stored in the security module of your SaaS platform.
- At a point, the user will arrive on a web page in the SaaS platform that has Qlik Sense content that must be shown.
- The user is redirected to the Qlik Sense Proxy that has a Virtual Proxy that will authenticate against a ticket. The user credentials have been verified when the user logged in on the SaaS platform so the authentication module will request a ticket form the Qlik Sense Proxy.  - The proxy will send a ticket to the authentication module. 
- The authentication module will redirect the user back to the Qlik Sense Proxy with a ticket. The proxy checks if the ticket is valid and has not timed out.
-  If the ticket is still valid, the proxy will create a session for the user and the user is authenticated.
- The Qlik Sense content is available.",,,,,,,,,

"Security - technical design","Qlik Sense security overview","!comment
There are some basic concepts that Qlik Sense uses in its security:
- Streams, Apps, Sheets: A Stream is like a folder where apps are stored. In order to provision an app to users, it must always be published in a stream. The app is a container with the Data(model), sheets with visualisations, Dimensions, Measures, Bookmarks and Stories. Normally security is implemented on stream level. It is very easy to give each customer its own stream and apps. But it is also possible to implement security on app or sheet level.
- Security rules: The security rules use ABAC (Attribute Base Access control).  A rule always uses this concept: 
 Allow the USER to do ACTION on the RESOURCE in ENVIRONMENT provided CONDITION . 
- Roles and groups: These need not to be created in Qlik Sense. In order to use them in the security rules, they can be re-used from the existing SaaS platform. Whenever a user needs Qlik Sense content, he needs to be authenticated. Often a ticket is used in order to authenticate. In that ticket the userid and group(s)are added, so that these can be used in the evaluation of the security rules and section access in Qlik Sense.
- Section Access: This part of security is in the script of the app. It offers row and column based security in the app. Whenever a user opens an app, its userid is checked. The user will only see his subset of the data, defined in the Section Access part.",,,,,,,,,

As said before, the authorization of Qlik Sense has 2 steps: 
 - Resource authorization: This is the first step of authorization. First of all, the user must see the correct content and resources: What Streams, apps, app objects, … does he have access to? This is all defined with the security rules in Qlik Sense.
 - Section Access: This second step will put a data filter on an app, so that the correct data is shown.  For example, when the Sales manager of Europe accesses the app, he/she will only see the data from the Europe region. When the Sales manager from America opens the same app, he/she will only see the data form the Americas. This is called row level security.",,,,,,,,,

Let's take a look at the concept of security rules: 
Allow the USER to do ACTION on the RESOURCE in ENVIRONMENT provided CONDITION .

- Action/Conditions: These are the actions that can be used in creating a rule. Some of the actions are only available for administrators (Change owner, change role). Some actions can only be used against a certain resource (Publish can only be used with the resource stream, as you cannot publish an app in another resource).

- Resources: These are the components where you can use an action on. There are resources on the Hub and on the Management Console(QMC). Depending on where you want your rule to be applied on, you must choose the correct context with the correct resource. Each context has some specific resources.

When the app is opened, the script in the Section Access part will be used in order to see what user has access to what dataset. There are 2 levels of access in Section Access:
 - ADMIN: Users in this access level will see all the data
 - USER: Users in this access level will only see a reduced subset of the data. Each user that will login can have a completely different subset to work with.

Section access will restrict the data in an app. A table is loaded or created in the script in a part that is identified by Section Access. This table has some fields that are necessary to make the data reduction work:
 - ACCESS: This field can have 2 values. ADMIN access gives full access to all the data. USER will used for users with restricted subsets.
 - USERID: This contains the userid of the user that needs to use the data of the app. In an embedded scenario this is most of the times passed by a ticket.
 - GROUP: The name of the group or role a certain user is member of. This is used to create the row level security on group level. This parameter can also be included in a ticket.
 - OMIT: This field contains names of fields that need to be omitted from a certain user. So instead of reducing rows, it is also possible to reduce columns.  
This table in the section access part will not appear in the data model of the app. This table only will make sure a user can open the app or not.

By adding another table that links a field from the section access table to a certain field from the data model, a link is created between the section access table and the data model. Whenever the app opens these tables will act as a 'filter' and only the associated data is  shown. 
The example on the slide shows that certain users can see specific orders and their associated data. The field AUTH_EMP_ID field is used for this.",,,,,,,,,

This slide shows an example: 
The first example shows a Section Access Table: 
The field TERRITORYCODE is being used to link certain users to a certain territory from the data model. This will act as a filter and will only show the corresponding territory and its associated data to a user. 
The OMIT field has been filled with the value 'population' for all the Access type users. This means that they will never see the population data for ANY territory.

The code shows 3 tables:
 - The first table in the Section Access part allows user1 and user2 to open the app. They have their designated group1 and 2. There is also an admin user.
 - The second table in the section access part is used to hide several fields from group 1 and 2.  
The last table is in the Section Application part of the app. This table links a field from the Section Access part to a value from the data model form the app.",,,,,,,,,

"Security - technical design","Row level security using groups in section access","!comment
Instead of using the USERID to make row level security, it might be easier to create the code based on groups. These groups are attributes of the user that can be passed through a ticket. This code shows that the first 3 users will have their designated groups (in this case countries). So it is very easy to link the GROUP field of the section access table to the country field in the dataset to apply the row level security. The last 3 users are administrators and they can see all the groups.

"Qlik Sense API introduction","API architecture interaction matrix","!comment This matrix provides an overview of where the interaction takes place (client or server) and on which platform. 

# Left: Your SaaS Platform
Your SaaS platform is represented on the left. 
## Client side 
Here you have your website running inside the browser of a computer or mobile phone of the user. In this browser the HTML will render the page (it provides placeholders for content). The CSS will do the colors and the layout, and the Javascript is responsible for all the interactivity. For example, if you press a selection button in your site, the Javascript will connect to the client side Sense APIs and make a selection. This is what we call a client side API call. The user is already authenticated in your Platform, and (somehow) has already received a Qlik Sense cookie. Therefore Qlik Sense knows who you are, and to which apps and data you have access to. Using Javascript we can automate all the activities a user would normally do. 

# Server side
Some use cases should only be done by users with special admin privileges. An example is the Single Sign on process. Only the service user of your SaaS platform should be allowed to request access for a user to Qlik Sense. Another example of server to server API calls are the execution of all activities related to the setup of your platform. For example in the integration.qlik.com demo, our server side tool inserts the license, creates apps, templates and uploads extensions etc.  It is common to use a Qlik Sense certificate for the authentication. You can get this ticket by exporting it in the QMC, and storing it on your SaaS platform. Next you will provide this certificate which each call you make. 

# On the right: Qlik Sense
## Front SaaS logoend focused 
Automate things on behalf of an end user 
- Open app 
- Make selection 
- Get chart or data 
- Create an app/chart on the fly

## Server side focused
- Authentication via QPS API:  login user (provide Single Sign On via a ticket request) 
- Administration (QMC) like activities via QRS API, (insert  or modify configuration, licenses, security rules, apps)
- Note that the engine API can be used for everything inside an app, so it can be seen as both relevant for front as well as back-end activities. If you have Javascript you can use EnigmaJS, for .NET you can use the .NET SDK or you can use any JSON RPC tool to talk directly to the engine API. But be aware this is a ""lower level API"" so the use of EnigmaJS is recommended. ",,,,,,,,,

 The typical wishes of a SaaS platform provider can be summarized in 3 main goals:
 - Create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment embedded analytics within the core application.
 - A certain level of self-service analytics should be provided to the users. Some users can have full self-service while other can be limited.
 - Provide dashboards in a fully automated way to the customers and users with the correct levels of security in place.",,,,,,,,,

The proxy will see the ticket, validate it and consume the ticket and if it's a valid ticket it will send the resource back to the browser with a session cookie attached to the response.

The figure above explains the key services of Qlik Sense.

The Qlik Sense services are the cornerstones of the Qlik Sense site architecture. The services can be deployed in different ways to suit different deployment purposes.

The Qlik Sense services are:

The Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS) manages persistence and synchronization of Qlik Sense apps, licensing, security, and service configuration data. The QRS attaches to a repository database and is needed by all other Qlik Sense services to run and serve Qlik Sense apps. The QRS also manages the synchronization used within multi-node Qlik Sense sites. In addition, the QRS stores the Qlik Sense app structures and the paths to the binary files (that is, the app data stored in the local file system).

In a default Qlik Sense installation, a Qlik Sense Repository Database (QRD) service is created specifically for use by the Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS). The QRS connects to the QRD to read and write data in the repository database. A PostgreSQL database is used by default.

The Qlik Sense Proxy Service (QPS) manages the Qlik Sense site authentication, session handling, and load balancing.

The Qlik Sense Scheduler Service (QSS) manages the scheduled reloads of Qlik Sense apps as well as other types of reload triggering (for example, task chaining) based on other task events.

The Qlik Sense Engine Service (QES) is the application service, which handles all application calculations and logic.",,,,,,,,,

# Data Access Layer
The associative model combines data from all data sources. You are not limited to any join type or number of data sources. You will basically get a ""full outer join"" but now better. Normally you would get data quality issues (double rows, incorrect figures) and a massive performance impact. Qlik Sense does not face these common issues which you get with SQL based tools because of its patented Associative QIX engine. Next this we know that your data never first your reporting needs  as delivered by your source. Therefore we offer an extensive ETL toolset so you can shape your data to match your reporting requirements. Examples are: combining multiple tables to form neat entities (customer or employee tables), or combining budget and actuals into 1 model, or maybe you would like to create a history of facts from the source?

# Applications Layer
Qlik Engine holds the application into memory for end user consumption. Multiple users can share this model if needed to optimize performance, or the models can be phyiscally splitted from security rand performance reasons, you have a choice....

# Web Layer
Qlik Sense Enterprise (QSE) Platform provides access through the web based Qlik Hub. It shows the different applications and streams available to the user.
In the Qlik Management Console (QMC) you can administer the Qlik Sense Site based on the Qlik Governance approach. Using the security rules you can precisely define who can do which admin activities basedd on the authorizations from your source platform. You don't need to create or maintain access rights in Qlik Sense as well. 

Since Qlik Sense is web based you can also easily embed the hub, a sheet or any visualization into a portal. 

# Summary
Users of all types can easily create and analyze in Qlik Sense using a unified HTML5 web based client, with no necessity for browser plugins, apps or fat desktop clients.
IT can utilize a simple and powerful, web based management console (QMC) for administration developed with the same technologies as the front-end client.
Developers can integrate data and build analytics using the web client, and can extend and customize Qlik Sense through standard and open API’s

Qlik supports a variaty of Authentication providers such as LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, SAML, JWT and others.
Qlik provides Client and server side  REST and websocket based APIs to automate or interact with external processes.

Based on your requirements you can choose on how you would like to prioritize your setup. A big server in the front end and a smaller one in the back? Or do you prefer two servers serving end users? In the last case one server will also do back end activities like reloading the data. 

You can configure a Qlik Sense enterprise deployment in a variety of different ways to suit the needs of your organization. For example, you can install Qlik Sense services to run on a single node or on multiple nodes for better performance and scalability. In a small single-node deployment, you deploy all services to a single server, which we do not recommend for larger organizations.

# More detailed information
In the next slides you will see multiple options to configure Qlik Sense deployments.

The following terms are used in the deployment scenarios:

Central node: the central point for managing all nodes in a site.
- Scheduler or Reload node: reloads apps on a schedule, but does not serve content to users.
- Consumer node: serves apps to users, but is not used to create, process, or reload data.
- Development node: allows users to create and reload new apps, but does not serve normal consumer traffic.
- Proxy node: provides load balancing of user traffic to other nodes but does not contain a Qlik Sense Engine Service (QES).",,"","","","","         0","0","Hosting Ops",

"Architecture","Scale out - creating separate sites (OEM)","!comment
In this scenerio have can have an unlimited number of users and customers/tenants in SaaS deployments. Your software (broker) creates a windows machine for each set of customers in the front end. This (clustered) front end machine reads the QVF file generated by the back-end from a shared folder. The back and front-end are different Qlik Sense sites. They don't share anything and as such have their own QMC. 

For example you can have 1000 customers on machine 1 and 1000 customers on machine 2 in the front. Machine 1 and 2 are also different Qlik Sense sites. So they have nothing in common. If you get another 10.000 customers you just spin up another x machines. All independent of each other. 

You will manage the whole configuration using the APIs. See the API chapters on integration.qlik.com for more information.

In QMC, go to Certificates section and export new certificates using the FQDN of the new server.
Be sure to include the Private key
We need the certificates to be in the Windows format
Record the UNC root path specified in the Service Cluster section in the QMC
Stop all services except for the Qlik Sense Repository Database
Create a new folder for the backup, e.g. C:\backup
Open MMC and Export the Trusted Root Certificate used by Qlik Sense from the Local Computer / Computer Account snap-in. And place it into the backup folder
Be sure to include the Private key
Take a backup of the database (relevant help link)
Sample command: ""C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin\pg_dump.exe"" -h localhost -p 4432 -U postgres -b -F t -f ""c:\backup\QSR_backup.tar"" QSR
Copy all subfolders in the UNC root specified in the Service Cluster Section in the QMC to the backup folder
Copy the Server certificate from the Exported Certificates folder to the backup folder (default: C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Exported Certificates)
Optional:
Zip the Backup folder for ease of transfer

# New Server
Install all Windows Updates
Update to the latest .NET Framework version
Verify that the C++ Redistributable is installed and patched
Visit help.qlik.com, click on your Sense software version, and verify that all pre-req's are met
Once all is complete, now you can install Qlik Sense on the new server (it has to be of the exact same version)
During the installation process uncheck the check box to start services after installation. We will want to do extra configuration before Qlik Sense initializes
Transfer the backup from the old server to local disk on the new server
While the installer is working:
Import the Trusted Root and Server certificate into the Local Computer / Computer Account snap-in section in their appropriate areas:
Server > Personal
Trusted Root > Trusted Root Certification Authorities
Note:​ Ensure that you mark the certificates as exportable
Note: If there are certificates which have already been generated (e.g. issued to newserver.company.com issued by newserver.company.com), then delete those
Once the installation has finished, start the Qlik Sense Repository Database
Restore the backed up copy of the database
Sample command: ""C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin\pg_restore.exe"" -h localhost -p 4432 -U postgres -d QSR ""c:\backup\QSR_backup.tar""
If using a different share path for the Qlik Sense content
Copy all subfolders from the UNC root specified in the Service Cluster Section in the QMC on the old server into a newly configured UNC path for the new server
Open QlikSenseUtil
Default path C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Util\QlikSenseUtil\QlikSenseUtil.exe
Click Connect to database
Enter superuser credentials
Click OK
Go to the Service cluster section
Click OK to get the current values
Make the appropriate edits
Click Save
To validate that the changes have been recorded:
Click Clear
Click OK
To launch Qlik Sense with the new hostname:
