- will enable a faster onboarding to the cloud providing faster time to market,
- With less ongoing development overhead,
- It will provide a clean separation of OEM’s customer tenants and the flexibility to integrate the partner’s solution(s) as needed, etc.
- Again this approach provides that necessary security layer, segregation and data governance with data privacy compliance.";;;;;;;;

"Multitenancy APIs";"Introduction to SaaS APIs";"To support the creation, configuration, and hydration of tenants for end customer onboarding in your applications, this series of tutorials demonstrates how the APIs can be used for:

- Tenant creation
- Tenant configuration
- Content hydration

## Create a new tenant
## Configure the new tenant, including:
  Configure an identity provider, typically either JSON Web Token (JWT) where integrating with existing applications, or an interactive provider such as Azure AD for other use cases
  - Pre-provision groups for access control
- Configure license and role allocations
- Create and configure security on spaces (logical buckets within a tenant for securing content)
- Configure web origin and content security policies for use with integrations or embedding

## Deploy content to the tenant, including:
- Import visualization extensions, themes and other content types required to provide customization of Qlik applications
- Import and stage Qlik applications in a shared space
- Publish staged applications to production managed spaces
- Republish updated applications";;;;;;;;

1 tenant per end customer + 1 dev/ staging tenant for the OEM partner (so n customer tenants + 1)
Provisioning, configuration and hydration are driven programmatically
No (or minimal, if interactive required) manual intervention required during provisioning
All tenants are created equal

# Key components:
1 Qlik partner : 1 license*
1 license : 1 organization
1 organization : n tenants to support n end customers
1 organization : 1 set of “credentials” per Qlik Cloud region 
1 set of “credentials”: 1 bot user**

"Architecture";"Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement";"# Embed";;;;;;;;
"Architecture";"Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement";"As for the Embedded Analytics part, we basically offer two different types of embedding strategies, the embedding via Iframe and the embedding using one of the available JS libraries. Let's see them in details in the next sections.

## IFRAME INTEGRATION
The simplest and by far the most common method of embedding into your solutions analytics built in Qlik Sense SaaS is certainly through the use of an Iframe. An Iframe is generally used to show the content of a web resource, in our case Qlik Sense, within a frame of a web page/main portal.

## JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION
As you already know from the Introduction section, Qlik Solutions are based on standard web-technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript and that makes life easier when dealing with integration scenarios. If we add to this the fact that Qlik provides developers with a complete set of Javascript APIs to connect to the Qlik engine, retrieve a previously created app, retrieve its objects (Charts, Filters, etc...) and render them within a web-based solution, we can say that the integration experience that you have using the Javascript libraries is 360 degrees integration which allows a bi-directional communication between the information and objects contained in your web portal with the information and visualization objects contained in the Qlik apps. You can use it when you typically have an existing portal/web-page and you want to embed Qlik into it. Not only that, with the JS APIs is possible to interact with the Qlik engine by applying selections rather than actions coming from the web components of the html page external to the Qlik Sense server itself. Let's think for example about a button rather than a dropdown menu natively present within your portal. When the user makes a selection of an item from the dropdown menu, you could trigger a call to the Qlik engine that applies a data selection in the application based on the value selected by the user.

In fact, Qlik APIs first approach allows many different level of integration. You can use APIs to extract information from the app data model to represent them within native objects of your solution or, viceversa by interacting with the native components of your solution you can trigger actions on the Qlik associative engine like for example applying a filter on the data that recalculates the Qlik charts in real time once you click on a dropdown menu, rather than a reset of the filters applied so far to the app.";;;;;;;;

Data is easily connected and profiled, key drivers are identified in the data set, and models are generated and refined using multiple regression techniques.  Predictions can then made and what-if scenarios tested.  Results are returned with prediction influencer data (Shapley values) at the record-level, explaining why predictions were made and allowing for better planning of decisions and actions.  Data can be easily published into Qlik Sense and other cloud platforms, and models can be integrated using advanced analytics integration for real-time exploratory analysis.  With AutoML, analytics teams can go beyond descriptive analysis to predictive and prescriptive analytics with a detailed understanding that is uniquely powerful when combined with Qlik’s best-in-class, associative exploration.";;;;;;;;

This website is completely focused in showing the key differentiators of our Qlik Sense APIs. What makes us truly unique?  
The website demonstrates a sample SaaS platform with Qlik Sense embedded. If focuses on the following topics through demos and demonstrations:
 - SaaS Provisioning: How can you embed the power of Qlik Sense  within a multi-tenant SaaS application environment. The demo shows you how you can automatically copy and distribute a Template application to each of your customers with their own data.
 - Self Service: This demo shows you the flexible possibilities of creating a personalized dashboard and report through different levels of self service.
 - Embed Qlik Sense: Qlik Sense is a software built from the ground up with the most recent web technologies. In this demo we show the different possibilities to embed Qlik Sense in your web platform.
 - Slide Generator: A collection of presentations and workshops about web, security and API integration with Qlik Sense. The slides are dynamically generated by out Engine API.  
 - Integration Questions? : Here you can find further in depth documentation and videos about integrating Qlik Sense in your platform.";;;;;;;;

The left side of the screen will show the 'broker'. This is a software capability that is already in place and manages the current SaaS platform. This piece of software will maintain the control of the SaaS platform and will communicate with our Sense platform through our APIs. This means that the control stays completely in the existing platform.

                            <li>The left side shows ""the broker"" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                            <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button, you also select an ""app"" to be used as a template for the layout.</li>
         <li><b>Select your apps</b> Which apps do your customers need to receive?</li>
                            <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                            <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the ""row level security"" app in the ""everyone stream"". This demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group membership.</li>
                        </ol> </p>";;;;;;;;

"Embed your app ";"Options to embed Qlik Sense: from simple to advanced use cases";"!comment
In our  'Embedding Qlik Sense' demo we have embedded  different parts of Qlik Sense.
On the left side of the screen you can choose which example you want to see. On the right side you will see the result.
Basically there are 3 main ways of embedding Qlik Sense:
 - Through an IFrame: This method allows to embed the full hub, a complete app, a complete sheets or a collection of multiple objects. It allows Qlik Sense to be embedded is a fast and easy way. When using IFrame you are using the layout and objects defined in Qlik Sense. Note that you can change the colors and fonts using ""themes"".
 - With Div tags you have the possibility to embed individual Qlik Sense objects like charts in a web page.  A Div tag is nothing more than a reserved place on a webpage. This allows you to make a customized webpage in which you can have your own layout and functionality.
- Finally you can use Qlik Sense APIs to get the data to be used by your own vizalization library. The JavaScript charts can be built on the fly through our APIs or via external visualizations libraries(Eg. D3 charts)";;;;;;;;
