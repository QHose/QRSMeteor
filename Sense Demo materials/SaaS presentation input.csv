"Licensing","# Principles and components
A license with multiple tenants entitlement:
Ability to create multiple tenants on that entitlement
Ability to create OAuth clients (i.e. credentials) in My Qlik

# Key principles:
1 tenant per end customer + 1 dev/ staging tenant for the OEM partner (so n customer tenants + 1)
Provisioning, configuration and hydration are driven programmatically
No (or minimal, if interactive required) manual intervention required during provisioning
All tenants are created equal

# Key components:
1 Qlik partner : 1 license*
1 license : 1 organization
1 organization : n tenants to support n end customers
1 organization : 1 set of “credentials” per Qlik Cloud region 
1 set of “credentials”: 1 bot user**

Data is easily connected and profiled, key drivers are identified in the data set, and models are generated and refined using multiple regression techniques.  Predictions can then made and what-if scenarios tested.  Results are returned with prediction influencer data (Shapley values) at the record-level, explaining why predictions were made and allowing for better planning of decisions and actions.  Data can be easily published into Qlik Sense and other cloud platforms, and models can be integrated using advanced analytics integration for real-time exploratory analysis.  With AutoML, analytics teams can go beyond descriptive analysis to predictive and prescriptive analytics with a detailed understanding that is uniquely powerful when combined with Qlik’s best-in-class, associative exploration.",,,,,,,,
