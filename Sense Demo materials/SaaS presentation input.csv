"Architecture","Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement","# Embed",,,,,,,,
"Architecture","Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement","As for the Embedded Analytics part, we basically offer two different types of embedding strategies, the embedding via Iframe and the embedding using one of the available JS libraries. Let's see them in details in the next sections.

## IFRAME INTEGRATION
The simplest and by far the most common method of embedding into your solutions analytics built in Qlik Sense SaaS is certainly through the use of an Iframe. An Iframe is generally used to show the content of a web resource, in our case Qlik Sense, within a frame of a web page/main portal.

## JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION
As you already know from the Introduction section, Qlik Solutions are based on standard web-technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript and that makes life easier when dealing with integration scenarios. If we add to this the fact that Qlik provides developers with a complete set of Javascript APIs to connect to the Qlik engine, retrieve a previously created app, retrieve its objects (Charts, Filters, etc...) and render them within a web-based solution, we can say that the integration experience that you have using the Javascript libraries is 360 degrees integration which allows a bi-directional communication between the information and objects contained in your web portal with the information and visualization objects contained in the Qlik apps. You can use it when you typically have an existing portal/web-page and you want to embed Qlik into it. Not only that, with the JS APIs is possible to interact with the Qlik engine by applying selections rather than actions coming from the web components of the html page external to the Qlik Sense server itself. Let's think for example about a button rather than a dropdown menu natively present within your portal. When the user makes a selection of an item from the dropdown menu, you could trigger a call to the Qlik engine that applies a data selection in the application based on the value selected by the user.

In fact, Qlik APIs first approach allows many different level of integration. You can use APIs to extract information from the app data model to represent them within native objects of your solution or, viceversa by interacting with the native components of your solution you can trigger actions on the Qlik associative engine like for example applying a filter on the data that recalculates the Qlik charts in real time once you click on a dropdown menu, rather than a reset of the filters applied so far to the app.",,,,,,,,

So you only need to change the S3 connection once for each tenant.   Each Qlik Sense cloud tenant has access to on premise data via the Qlik Data Gateway - Data Movement.

The left side of the screen will show the 'broker'. This is a software capability that is already in place and manages the current SaaS platform. This piece of software will maintain the control of the SaaS platform and will communicate with our Sense platform through our APIs. This means that the control stays completely in the existing platform.

In this demo, the broker will define following parameters:
 - Which customers need access to the applications?
 - What will be the roles and the access rights to the apps?
 - Which apps should be provided?",,,,,,,,

<p> This demo shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a ""template layout"" for each of your customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.

 In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The left side shows ""the broker"" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                            <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button, you also select an ""app"" to be used as a template for the layout.</li>
         <li><b>Select your apps</b> Which apps do your customers need to receive?</li>
                            <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                            <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the ""row level security"" app in the ""everyone stream"". This demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group membership.</li>
                        </ol> </p>",,,,,,,,

A user can be a computer or a human. What defines a user is the fact that it has a userID, that it belongs to a certain customer and that it has one or multiple groups. When that user logs on to the SaaS platform, he is authenticated.  At the point he needs to see Qlik Sense content, that user needs to be authenticated with Qlik Sense. At this point this information is passed through by means of a ticket. (There are other methods, but here we use ticketing). This ticket contains the userID and additional attributes ( like groups, specific script content,….). On this website thery are stored in a Mongo Database. Through APIs these can be fetched and passed to Qlik Sense. Based on the userID and group(s) the correct content will be shown and the user will have the correct rights based on the group membership.",,,,,,,,

It’s possible for each customer to have a more finely tuned authorization structure. For example, it is possible to provide authorizations for a specific department or country within a dashboard. You’ll see a simple solution in our demonstration where both of our fictitious users, Peter and John, go to the same website, but see different things based on their authorizations. Qlik Sense makes this possible because it uses a dynamic, attribute-based security approach in which we re-use all the pre-existing users and roles from your SaaS platform.

"Integration.qlik.com demo platform","OEM good practice summary","This is a typical scenario we use in OEM use cases where we have relatively small data sets for each customer.

"Integration.qlik.com demo platform","OEM good practice summary","# Embed",,,,,,,,
"Integration.qlik.com demo platform","OEM good practice summary","As for the Embedded Analytics part, we basically offer two different types of embedding strategies, the embedding via Iframe and the embedding using one of the available JS libraries. Let's see them in details in the next sections.

## IFRAME INTEGRATION
The simplest and by far the most common method of embedding into your solutions analytics built in Qlik Sense SaaS is certainly through the use of an Iframe. An Iframe is generally used to show the content of a web resource, in our case Qlik Sense, within a frame of a web page/main portal.

## JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION
As you already know from the Introduction section, Qlik Solutions are based on standard web-technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript and that makes life easier when dealing with integration scenarios. If we add to this the fact that Qlik provides developers with a complete set of Javascript APIs to connect to the Qlik engine, retrieve a previously created app, retrieve its objects (Charts, Filters, etc...) and render them within a web-based solution, we can say that the integration experience that you have using the Javascript libraries is 360 degrees integration which allows a bi-directional communication between the information and objects contained in your web portal with the information and visualization objects contained in the Qlik apps. You can use it when you typically have an existing portal/web-page and you want to embed Qlik into it. Not only that, with the JS APIs is possible to interact with the Qlik engine by applying selections rather than actions coming from the web components of the html page external to the Qlik Sense server itself. Let's think for example about a button rather than a dropdown menu natively present within your portal. When the user makes a selection of an item from the dropdown menu, you could trigger a call to the Qlik engine that applies a data selection in the application based on the value selected by the user.

In fact, Qlik APIs first approach allows many different level of integration. You can use APIs to extract information from the app data model to represent them within native objects of your solution or, viceversa by interacting with the native components of your solution you can trigger actions on the Qlik associative engine like for example applying a filter on the data that recalculates the Qlik charts in real time once you click on a dropdown menu, rather than a reset of the filters applied so far to the app.",,,,,,,,

#Some basic principles in setting up SaaS provisioning with Qlik Sense:
 - Create 1 or multiple template apps per business or process area. This way the different apps are relatively small and easy to maintain. Also administrator(s) per area can maintain their specific content. A template app contains about 80% of all layout, sheets and charts.
 - Apps can be manually created through the Qlik Sense Hub or through an API call. 
 - When the template app will be copied to make the customer specific one, the customer specific data must be loaded in the app. A modification must be made to the script to made it customer specific. Most of the time only the database connection must be changed as most of the customers will have the same structure in tables and fields. 
 - The modification of the script can be done through APIs. Basically you wil GET the script, find the placeholder for the connection string, and replace it with the customer specific string. There is also a possibility of using and INCLUDE file: This is an external file that contains customer specific script.

# To summarize:  
What you want is that all of your customers will get their own app with their own data.
For this we use a piece of software that you will probably already use today, a ""Broker/API connector"" that sets up or maintains your SaaS platform. On the Qlik Sense SaaS environment we have already our template apps. These are apps that already have a script, data model and layout ready. Whenever we need to provision an app the following steps happen: 
 - A tenant is created for each customer.
 - A copy of the template app will be made on this new tenant 
 - The data load script (a bunch of SQL/REST statements) is modified with the correct source connection to make sure the correct data is loaded for that specific customer.
 - The app is reloaded during which the data is indexed (a compressed copy) into the Qlik Sense app,
 - The app gets published in the correct space.
- Group membership is assigned to this space
- Now users can login into your SaaS platform, it will create a JWT token (including the userId and groups), and sign in the user into Qlik Sense SaaS. ","","","","","         0","0","Multiple days, Technical - 2 hours",

"Qlik Sense app","Introduction to embedded analytics with Qlik","What would the end result look like for a succesful integration of Qlik Sense into your application architecture?

Your goal is to create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment - embedded analytics - within your core application(s) where each of your customers would see and use only their data. 

It’s possible for each customer to have a more fine grained authorization structure.  As an example, it is possible to provide authorizations for a specific department or country within a dashboard.

Ultimately you will see a simple solution in our demonstration in which both of our fictitious users, Peter and John, go to the same website, but see different things based on their authorizations. Qlik Sense makes this possible because it uses a dynamic attribute-based security approach in which we re-use all the pre-existing users and roles from your SaaS platform.   This ensures Qlik Sense stays automatically in synch and avoids the overhead of double maintenance.",,,,,,,,

"Qlik Sense app","Introduction to embedded analytics with Qlik","The integration of two software platforms entails multiple considerations. Each platform has its own nuances.  In our illustrated approach here, we deconstruct our integration approach into the following categories:
dashboard, data, security, web, APIs and architecture.  In the following slides we cover each category. 

Before we discuss the first category, it’s important that you understand what an application is and how we work with the app. 
We typically create a template app for each business process or domain found in your software. 
We then use the APIs to copy and reload the app with customer specific data for each of your customer instances. 
When the app is published or made available, your customers can view their unique application instance with the relevant charts embedded in your SaaS platform.  
The Qlik APIs will then be used to copy and rerun the application with customer specific data for each unique instance.

Once the app is published, your customers can view the app and its charts that are embedded in your multi-tenant SaaS platform.  
Using ‘ticketing’, Qlik Sense dynamically re-uses your existing users and their authorizations which ensures an secure, integrated approach.  ",,,,,,,,

Click on the link to see our self-service demo. With our governed self-service you have the possibility to define how to implement guided self-service. By creating roles or groups we have created different levels of self service on Qlik Sense.
 - A consumer can only analyze data.
 - A contributor can create own private sheets.
 - A developer has the possibility to create its own sheets and apps.
 - An admin can maintain the content of its department through the Qlik Management Console (QMC).

By using row level security each user can only see the data it has access to.
In the example here, John can only see data from Germany and Linda can only see data from the USA while Martin can see all the data.",,,,,,,,

You can see a Qlik Sense app as a container with 2 main layers:
**First you have the foundation of the app. This contains:**
 -The Data Model: The app contains all the data and the associations between the data. These components makes the associative data model. This means whenever you work in the app, no direct connection is needed to analyze the data. When the app is opened, the whole data model is loaded in the memory which makes for very fast and complete analysis.
 -The script: Data can be loaded in the app through the Data Manager or the Data Load Editor. With the data manager  you load and connect the data in a visual way. The script will be automatically generated. You can also create the script manually through the data load editor. This option gives you more freedom to manipulate your data and script. The script contains connections to your data, the load statements, modifications in order to create a good model (ETL- Extract - Transform-Load), variables,… . 
To resume, the script is needed to extract, transform and load your data in a Qlik Sense app, in order to create your data model.
 - Measures and Dimensions: In order to show the data in Qlik Sense it is needed to have some well defined measures and dimensions. 
This makes the end user experience a lot easier.
But what are they?  
  - Measures: WHAT do you want to see ? This is always a calculation that will show numbers. (Example: I want to see my Sales. ) These calculations will return 1 number. We call those aggregation calculations. The most commonly known ones are SUM,COUNT,MIN,MAX,AVG. So to calculate my Sales, the formula could be : SUM(Sales).  
  - Dimensions: HOW do you want to see it? (Example: I want to see my Sales by Country). In this case the field that contains the list of countries is used as a dimension. For each country, the Sales will be shown.

**Second you have the visual interface of the app. This contains:**
 - Sheet with visualizations: Here you can add new visualizations on sheets, modify your sheets and analyze your data .
 - Bookmarks: A bookmark is a saved state of selection. You can make new ones or apply existing bookmarks.
 - Stories: Stories give you the possibility to tell a story about your data. You can make snapshots of your sheet objects and use them in your story. You can add additional text, images and effects to your story to make it more clear. You can also add full sheets into your story. At any given time you have the possibility to go back to your source data on your sheets, make selections and go back to your story.
