Most of the time the following scenario is used:
The employees will use Qlik Sense internally with full self service capabilities.They will also create the dashboards for other users.External users like customer and suppliers might need to see some data from Qlik Sense. They will login in a web portal and they will see only their relevant data. In that case Qlik Sense is embedded in the web environment. They will often have less or no self-service capabilities.",,,,,,,,,

One of the biggest advantages of Qlik Sense is the fact that an app can be used for all devices. Qlik Sense uses and supports a range of modern technologies:- HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript: These technologies are used to embed Qlik Sense in a web environment. The HTML will define the frame of the webpage, CSS will style the page while JavaScript will take care of the behavior.
- RequireJS, AngularJS: These frameworks are being used by Qlik Sense and can be easily reused in the web environment.
- JSON is the language being used to communicate with our engine and other services.
- The way Qlik Sense communicates with its own and other services is done through the WebSocket protocol.
- CANVAS is being used to create visualizations.
- REST is being used to make sure the API's are working correctly.",,,,,,,,,

# What is the hub?
The Qlik Sense Hub can be seen as the starting page of a Qlik Sense environment . On the left you have an overview of all the streams a user has access to. Per stream it shows an overview of all the apps where a user has access to.

On the top of the slide you can choose between 3 possible views:
 - Result: shows the result of the embedded hub.
 - HTML: Shows the HTML code for embedding the hub. It makes use of an IFrame. The URL is the source where the IFrame refers to.

# This slide shown an example of generating a bar chart on the fly with our visualization API.
On top the different parts of the embedding can be shown: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Resources and Result.
 -  The first part shows the config object. This is needed to know where the API needs to connect to get the data. The host is the hostname of the Qlik Sense Server. Is Secure is the parameter that decides that SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)should be used or not. The prefix tells to which Qlik Sense Virtual Proxy should be connected and trough which port.
 - The second part will create the bar chart with Qlik Sense Data.
  ○ Require(['js/qlik'], function(qlik):
  This will always appear at the beginning of you JavaScript code. This is necessary to use the Qlik API's.
  ○ Qlik.openApp: Here an API is used to open a Qlik Sense app. The first parameter is the GUID of the app. The second parameter refers to the config object.
  ○ App.visualization.create: This API will make a Qlik Sense visualization. The first parameter defines it is going to be a bar chart. The second parameters contains the Dimension(s) ( in this case 'Country)' and Measure(s) ( in this case '=count(Customer))'for the bar chart. A lot of parameters can be defined here. In this example the bar chart will get the title: ""on the fly barchart"".
After that the bar chart is shown in a specific placeholder in de webpage. The placeholder is defined in the HTML code.
On the top of the slide you can choose between the 5 possible views.",,,,,,,,,

!comment
There are 3 main options for embedding:
 - IFrame: A very easy method of embedding the Hub, App, Sheet or an object. Basically with an IFrame you embed another document in the current HTML document.- Div Tag: An HTML page can have reserved spaces ( or placeholders). These are defined with Div tags. With our Capability API's it is possible to put Qlik Sense objects in these Div tags.
 On the fly: Instead of already creating an object in a Qlik Sense app and then using it in a HTML page, it is possible to create the object on the fly in the JavaScript of the webpage. Through our visualization API we give you the possibility to generate charts or other objects on the fly. This gives you the possibility to only generate the charts whenever a user logs in, giving you lots of flexibility.",,,,,,,,,

Through our  'Embedding Qlik Sense' demo on integration.qlik.com you will notice we have embedded  different parts of Qlik Sense.
On the left side of the screen you can choose which example you want to see. On the right side you will see the result.
Basically there are 3 main ways of emdedding Qlik Sense:
 - Trough an IFrame: This method allows to embed the full hub, a complete app, complete sheets or a collection of multiple apps.
 It allows Qlik Sense to be embedded is a fast and easy way. When using IFrame you are using the layout and objects define in Qlik Sense.
 - With Div tags you have the possibility to embed individual objects in a web page.  A Div tag is nothing more than a reserved place on a webpage. This allows you to make a customized webpage, that used Qlik Sense object.
Finally you can use Qlik Sense APIs to provide the data. In the JavaScript charts can be built on the fly through our API or  external visualizations (Eg. D3 charts)",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense Enterprise you have all the possible options to embed.The Enterprise edition also contains the hub and it's corresponding menus, toolbars and buttons. This makes it possible to also use these in your embedding.When choosing the Qlik Analytics Platform (QAP) you have all the same possibilities, except the whole visual layer. This means there is no hub, app overview, menu, toolbars,.. So with the QAP you can only embed a sheet (without menu), an object and data on the fly.",,,,,,,,,

# An overview of the key APIs
 - Re-use: If you want to reuse Qlik Sense components in your website. This can be the hub, an app, a sheet or objects. For this DIV tags or IFrame are used.
 - On the fly: This means that App, data or objects are only created or provisioned whenever a customer logs in. This can be from creating an App on demand, only load in customer specific data in an App to creating a chart on the fly using HTML or JavaScript code
 - Extend: With our collection of APIs you can make chart types that were not out of the box available, but act as native Qlik Sense objects. You can also add widgets to improve the look and feel of you Qlik Sense application.On branch.qlik.com you can find a collection of third party extensions, free for download or you can add your own extensions there.
Data only: Instead of using Qlik Sense with its visual layer, only the  fast in-memory data warehouse of Qlik is used. Through API calls in JSON format you can create your own visual layer by using Qlik Sense as your backbone for data delivery and data associations.",,,,,,,,,

This slide shows you an overview of all the components that are used for embedding trough an IFrame. 
 - On the SaaS platform you have the webpage, consisting out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the HTML, the IFrame refers to a component of Qlik Sense.
 - At the point that the HTML page is loaded, connection to the Qlik Sense server is needed. To get access to the server, the Virtual proxy must be passed first (authenticating).
On the bottom of the screen there are 2 examples of IFrame URL. The first one shows a sheet in an analysis state. The second one shows a sheet where a certain selection has been made.",,,,,,,,,

# Pro and con
## Pro
 - It is very easy to embed content in a page. There is no need of knowing specific or difficult HTML statements.
 - It is very simple to separate content onto several pages. A part of the page can stay static while other content can be dynamic
 - There is no collision between layout, CSS styles as it is a separate website.
## Cons
 - You do not have a single HTML page and the IFrame integrates another one in the current HTML page. So at least 2 of them need to be maintained, and code is separated. 
 - Sizing an IFrame is considerably more work.
 - Broken framesets might be an issue.

Qlik Sense capabilities APIs are a collection of JavaScript APIs that allows you to easily embed Qlik Sense content in a web page.
Our capability APIs are dependent on AngularJS and RequireJS. When integrating our APIs in an existing project, the same libraries must be used.
With our capability APIs existing visualizations of Qlik Sense can be used or created on the fly and can be embedded in a web page. But it goes further: Data, selections, bookmarks, variables,…. Can all be obtained and used.

Whenever you open a HTML page, a lot of things are being loaded in the background.In this overview you see that a user logs in to a SaaS platform. It contains several HTML pages which have to 'show' something.This can consist out of:
 - CSS: CSS is used to style the HTML page ( color, borders, sizing,…)
 - JavaScript: Is used for the behaviors of the page. For example: If you click on a button, the current selections must be cleared. That action is being executed in the JavaScript.
 - Images can be loaded in.
Different fonts can be used and must be loaded in also.",,,,,,,,,

Click on the link to go to the integration demo. The second part on the left side shows different examples using div tags.
The difference with an IFrame is that instead of embedding a full site, app or sheet, individual objects are embedded. Each object is placed in a placeholder. In the HTML code we used the Div tags as placeholders.In the demo there are different examples which can be viewed.
 - Multiple charts

This slide shows the JavaScript example of using our capability APIs for integrating Qlik Sense objects into a webpage trough Div tags.
First the Qlik Sense app needs to be opened to get to the content and objects that need to be embedded. This happens on the line of code that starts with 'var app':
The API qlik.openApp is used to create an object that gets access to the desired app.
The long number is the internal GUID of the app that is used in our Qlik Sense environment. The config object is used to make sure the right connection is made with the Qlik Sense Server.

Secondly there are 2 lines that start with 'app.getObject':
This API gets the GUID of the object ( the second parameter) and puts it in the desired placeholder (first parameter). These placeholders are defined in the HTML code of the web page with Div tags.

Click on the links on top to toggle between HTML, JavaScript, Resources, CSS and Result.

The Host white list is a property on the Qlik Sense virtual proxies.  In there the hostnames, IP addresses or subdomains can be filled in.
Now in an integration example:
First you have the webpages of the SaaS platform which contain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTTP origin header comes from the SaaS platform web server. Whenever Qlik Sense is embedded though IFrame or Div tags , it also uses web content which again uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But here the HTTP origin header comes from Qlik Sense.
Whenever the page on the SaaS platform is loaded, it will need the embedded content from Qlik Sense. To get to the content you always need to pass the Qlik Sense virtual proxy. If the virtual proxy does not know the address, hostname,… of the server then there will no WebSocket connection allowed. The page will not load in the Qlik Sense content. 
When an additional header is supplied, the address needs not to be added to the whitelist : Access-Control-Allow-Origin *. Instead of using *, use your protocol, server, port combination.

#This slide gives an overview which steps are executed to use our Capabilities API.The user is authenticated in the SaaS platform and arrives on a web page with embedded Qlik Sense objects through our Capabilities API in the JavaScript and Div tags in the HTML.In order to show the Qlik Sense content, the user must be authenticated in the Qlik Sense system. So first of all there has to be an authentication check through a Qlik Sense virtual proxy. (Most of the time this is done through ticketing or HTTP header). If the user fails the authentication check, a WebSocket error will occur.If the authentication was successful, the Require.JS starts. This is a module loader that loads in all the required components in the right order to make sure the Qlik Sense objects can be loaded. These components are Qlik.js, the client-CSS and fonts.When these are loaded in, it is important the right objects are shown. First authorizing happens. This is done by our security rules. If a certain user does not have access to a certain app or object the Qlik Sense content will not be shown in the embedded HTML page.
Finally Section Access is used to make sure row level security is executed.",,,,,,,,,

#This slide gives an overview which steps are executed when a page with mashups is shown:
In the existing SaaS platform there are webpages. They consist out of:- HTML with Div tags where Qlik Sense objects are embedded. 
 - CSS for the styling.
 - JavaScript to use our APIs to embed the Qlik Sense objects in the Div tags.
When the page is shown, the user must be authenticated first. So a authentication check is done through our virtual proxy . (Most of the time this is done through ticketing or HTTP header). If the user fails the authentication check, a WebSocket error will occur.After the user is authenticated the Qlik Sense engine will provide the corresponding objects. Authorization through our security rules will determine if the user has access to the correct stream(s) and app(s).At that point there can be a choice to use an existing chart, to create a new one on the fly by our Visualizations API or simply get the data from the app. (that data can be used in a third party visualization). In order to show only the correct data, Section Access is applied.",,,,,,,,,

JavaScript is a vast collection of different libraries and frameworks, each with their own set of requirements.
Require.js is a framework that loads in the required pieces of software (called packages or modules) and also in the correct order as certain frameworks are dependent of others.Qlik Sense uses a modified version Require.js. Certain pieces of code have been added to make sure all out APIs work properly.
(at the beginning of the JavaScript code of a mashup, you always the following line: 'require( [""js/qlik""], function ( qlik )'. This is the call for the Qlik require framework.)
This modified version of Qlik is not the same as the default require.js. In order to make sure Qlik Sense works properly, your web platform MUST use the same version of require.js as the version that ships with Qlik Sense. If not the mashup will fail to work.

This code shows 2 ways of creating Qlik Sense visualizations on the fly:
 - Through our APIs - app.visualization.create: This API will make a Qlik Sense visualization. The first parameter defines it is going to be a bar chart. The second parameters contains the Dimension(s) ( in this case 'Country)' and Measure(s) ( in this case '=sum(LineSalesAmount)'for the bar chart. After the creation the bar chart is shown in the designated div placeholder.
 - Trough visuals web components: This way there is no need for JavaScript. First the correct app is opened.
 After that the type of the chart is chosen (here a barchart)
 After that the columns are defined: '[Case Owner Group]' as dimension and '=Avg([Case Duration Time])' as measure.
The chart gets the title: 'on the fly barchart'.",,,,,,,,,

This method is used whenever a user or company wants to maintain their own look and feel - house style (colors, fonts, specific customized visualizations,…) or the user has already a full library of its own visualizations and wants to use those.
As said on the previous slide, it gives the users the possibility to create their own visual layer while maintaining the associative power of Qlik Sense. This means that ALL the data will be completely visual at ALL times.Through the communication of the SaaS platform and Qlik Sense trough WebSockets, your data keeps in sync. Selections can be made as in a native Qlik Sense visualization. As the data is connected, all the other visualizations or object will react to the selections.
Really the sky is the limit here: The possibility to create a completely customized visual layer on the associative Qlik Sense model.

With the Table API it is possible to retrieve any combination of dimensions and measures.In the code, first the correct app is opened to have access to the dataset.After that the 'app.createTable' API is used to create the data table on the fly. In this example the tale has 2 dimensions: 'Country' and 'City' and 1 measure : 'Sum(LineSalesAmount)'. The rows parameter defines the maximum rows of the table.
At the end the result will be shown with an onData event.",,,,,,,,,

A short video that shows the power of visualization extensions. The big difference between widgets and extensions is that widgets do not use JavaScript. They only use HTML and CSS.

So if the function that you shared is called every time they flip between the panels in the end you will have a lot of active visualization models.

Which all will react to every selection you make in the app and start fetching data even though they aren't rendering anything to the screen.

That's usually the main culprit when people experience that the app gets slow over time. (Source: Alexander Karlsson)",,,,,,,,,

- We created a table with slide titles and their contents (bullets such as texts, links to images/videos, raw HTML or markDown)
- We can assign ""each bullet/video/image"" to a workshop or audience.
- We can re-use content in multiple workshops
- We can arrange workshops in a hierarchy in such a way that we only have to assign ""a bullet/video/image"" to one child workshop, and his parents automatically get access to. (simplifies maintenance). E.g. all slides that are assigned to the 1 hour workshop also become available in the 2 hour and 1 day workshop.

For example, when updating an entity, leave the modifiedDate property unchanged. If the modifiedDate property for the updated entity differs from the modifiedDate property for the entity in the QRS, there is a conflict (that is, the entity in the QRS has already been updated by someone else).",,"","","","","         0","0","Deep dive",

"QPS - Proxy API","Use ticketing without the extra redirect","Its possible to directly pass on a ticket the first time you make a call to a static asset in Qlik Sense. See the comment from Alex below
- if you do ticketing how it works is that you get a ticket from your auth module and then you fetch a static resource from behind the proxy such as the require.js file with `qlikTicket=<ticket value>` appended to the url. The proxy will see the ticket, validate it and consume the ticket and if it's a valid ticket it will send the resource back to the browser with a session cookie attached to the response. The browser will then append the session cookie to future requests and the proxy will see the session cookie and let the requests through",,,,,,,,,
