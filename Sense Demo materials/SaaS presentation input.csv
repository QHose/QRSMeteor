Now imagine this: You need to give a presentation to a group of people. You have prepared your deck, but at the presentation you notice that some slides are too technical for some people. Also some topics were not relevant, so these slides are not shown either and maybe you forgot to have slides over a certain topic. With Qlik Sense and this slide generator we have shown the power of Qlik and its associative model.

When you start the slide generator, you select what level you are. After that you use the power of Qlik Sense associative model to choose your topics.  After you have chosen what you want to see, we make a request to Qlik Sense.  Qlik Sense dynamically gives us the requested data and the slides are generated on the fly, with the right content.

This video explains the core differentia tor of Qlik. This is our way of visualizing ALL your data. Our QIX engine makes sure that all your data is connected and available for complete analysis. We do not use Query based calculations on the data. With queries you will lose a part of your data, your performance will suffer or you need to add additional performance enhancement tools in between. Which will impact complexity of your system landscape. With our QIX technology, you will never have those problem and you will keep your environment simple with just 1 platform: Qlik Sense.

Click on the link to see our self-service demo. With our governed self-service you have the possibility to define how to implement guided self-service. By creating roles or groups we have created different levels of self service on Qlik Sense.
 - A consumer can only analyze data.
 - A contributor can create own private sheets.
 - A developer has the possibility to create its own sheets and apps.
 - An admin can maintain the content of its department through the Qlik Management Console (QMC).

By using row level security each user can only see the data it has access to.
In the example here, John can only see data from Germany and Linda can only see data from the USA while Martin can see all the data.",,,,,,,,,

You can see a Qlik Sense app as a container with 2 main layers:
**First you have the foundation of the app. This contains:**
 -The Data Model: The app contains all the data and the associations between the data. These components makes the associative data model. This means whenever you work in the app, no direct connection is needed to analyze the data. When the app is opened, the whole data model is loaded in the memory which makes for very fast and complete analysis.
 -The script: Data can be loaded in the app through the Data Manager or the Data Load Editor. With the data manager  you load and connect the data in a visual way. The script will be automatically generated. You can also create the script manually through the data load editor. This option gives you more freedom to manipulate your data and script. The script contains connections to your data, the load statements, modifications in order to create a good model (ETL- Extract - Transform-Load), variables,… . 
To resume, the script is needed to extract, transform and load your data in a Qlik Sense app, in order to create your data model.
 - Measures and Dimensions: In order to show the data in Qlik Sense it is needed to have some well defined measures and dimensions. 
This makes the end user experience a lot easier.
But what are they?  
  - Measures: WHAT do you want to see ? This is always a calculation that will show numbers. (Example: I want to see my Sales. ) These calculations will return 1 number. We call those aggregation calculations. The most commonly known ones are SUM,COUNT,MIN,MAX,AVG. So to calculate my Sales, the formula could be : SUM(Sales).  
  - Dimensions: HOW do you want to see it? (Example: I want to see my Sales by Country). In this case the field that contains the list of countries is used as a dimension. For each country, the Sales will be shown.

**Second you have the visual interface of the app. This contains:**
 - Sheet with visualizations: Here you can add new visualizations on sheets, modify your sheets and analyze your data .
 - Bookmarks: A bookmark is a saved state of selection. You can make new ones or apply existing bookmarks.
 - Stories: Stories give you the possibility to tell a story about your data. You can make snapshots of your sheet objects and use them in your story. You can add additional text, images and effects to your story to make it more clear. You can also add full sheets into your story. At any given time you have the possibility to go back to your source data on your sheets, make selections and go back to your story.

"What is an app?","Self service data preparation","!comment Self-service data preparation includes a number of visual and smart capabilities for integrating multiple data sources, transforming data, and loading it for analysis, without the need for scripting.

Using a graphical interface with tables represented as ‘bubbles’, users can drag-and-drop to connect data sets together from multiple sources.  Qlik Sense intelligently profiles the data sets and automatically suggests the most relevant associations between them, allowing users to bring together disparate sources without having to be data experts.

Qlik Sense also includes additional smart profiling capabilities, including automatic handling of date and time information, and recognition / preparation of geographic information.  Visual data transformation capabilities include the ability to create bins of data based for numeric fields, concatenate tables, create derived fields, and automatically handle pivot tables.  And graphical data prep is now integrated with scripting, so more advanced transformations can be represented as ‘bubbles’.

Qlik Sense includes a dedicated data manager space, new menus for easily selecting different data sources from our broad set of connectors, an improved scripting interface, and smart capabilities to offer insights about data sets represented as histograms and other statistics.  And with Qlik DataMarket, users can add external data sets to analysis to broaden perspective.

Going forward, we will be making our data prep capabilities smarter and more powerful.  We will be adding more graphical and automated data transformation capabilities, and further enhancing our data profiling capabilities to identify and automatically process more data types. We will get even smarter about recommending associations and relationships in data, and generating key insights for further analysis. And data augmentation suggestions will be provided to users, based on a global library of internal and external sources.

When you open Qlik Sense, you will arrive on a screen where you can open your apps. This is called the Qlik Sense hub. You will notice that on the left side, there are different streams. When you click on a stream, you'll see the apps from the selected stream on the main screen.
You can compare a stream to a folder. In order to present apps to end users, the apps must be put in a certain stream, otherwise the app will not be visible for end users. We call that publishing an app into a stream. This method makes sure that apps get grouped into a stream. Later on it becomes very easy to put security rules on stream level. So when a user logs on, he/she will only see the streams with its corresponding apps where he/she has access to.",,,,,,,,,

One of the big powers of Qlik Sense is our QIX engine. Its power allows you to make fast analysis over large sets of data from different data sources. In order to improve this process we use different methods:
 - The data stored in an app is always indexed. This gives a huge boost in compression of the data in the memory (Up to 90x times).
 - Through the creation of the associative model, our Engine can apply associative search and analysis on the data set. Every piece of data is available for selection and analysis.
Through our compression and indexing techniques our Engine can handle huge data sets in the memory.",,,,,,,,,

By combining data from different data sources, Qlik Sense makes it possible to see the 'Why' in your data. 
In this example the Sales can be interpreted: Why did a certain product have bad sales? Maybe there was a problem with the inventory? By combining the weather data from another data source, the reason why the product wasn't delivered was due to extreme bad weather….

By combining all the data in our associative model, new insights can be discovered.",,,,,,,,,

This video shows our visual data modeling in the June 2017 release:  
Preparing data has never been so easy to do. Some of the new improved features are :
 - More connectors are available to connect to data sources.
 - When choosing a dimension, a chart is automatically created where the distribution of that dimension can be seen.
 - When choosing a measure, there is now a possibility to create 'buckets' or intervals in that measure.
 - Values in a field can now be easily transformed.  Values can be replaced, set to null, sorted or split .
 - Scripted tables can now be 'synchronized'. This means that tables that were created in the data load editor can be used in the visual data manager by synchronizing them. 
 - Tables can be concatenated without using the script. The fields can be visually mapped to make sure the right fields of one table are concatenated correctly with fields of the other table.

SaaS stands for Software As A Service. It is a method of software delivery that allows data to be accessed from any device with an Internet connection and web browser. 
In this web-based model, software vendors host and maintain the servers, databases and code that constitute an application. 
In addition to allowing remote access via the web to the software applications and data, SaaS also differs from on-premise software in its pricing model:
It allows buyers to pay an annual or monthly subscription fee, which typically includes the software license, support and most other fees.

An example of this is Gmail : All users logon on the same website (gmail.com) but when they login users only see their emails. Everything is hosted by Google. No local installation of software is needed.

 The typical wishes of a SaaS platform provider can be summarized in 3 main goals:
 - Create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment embedded analytics within the core application.
 - A certain level of self-service analytics should be provided to the users. Some users can have full self-service while other can be limited.
 - Provide dashboards in a fully automated way to the customers and users with the correct levels of security in place.

The ultimate goal of this website is taking the audience on a journey where the unique capabilities of Qlik Sense are demonstrated in a clear and guided way. These capabilities are:
 - A multi-tenant API solution for both Qlik Sense hub and QMC. This uses  the loop and reduce principle is used: Template applications are copied and published for each customer (loop) but with reduced data. Each customer will see only see its own data. (reduce)
 - SaaS with Qlik Sense demonstration.
 - Throughout the demo the different APIs and interactions will be seen. It is also possible so take a look to the underlying API source code for each of the actions.
 - Different levels of self-service will be explained and shown throughout the demo.
 - The setup of this demonstration website needs a few important security rules to be set in place. These are available on the website and show how flexible they are to use.
 - The different embedding possibilities of Qlik Sense are showcased. From IFrame and DIV tags to using Qlik Sense as your data provider so that customized visualizations can be used. With our API's,  the sky is the limit.",,"","","","","         0","0","CTO",

APIs are our secret sauce so this website is specifically designed to illustrate the unique selling points of our Qlik Sense APIs. Our goal is to illustrate the power of Qlik Sense APIs in language that can be easily understood by non-technical business users or decision-makers via our step-by-step walk-through. This learning environment was developed using our experiences with AFAS, as well as other key customer accounts. We are eager to explain, excite and reassure senior executives and management about the Qlik platform by modeling its ease of use and full automation capabilities.

Our presentation precedes our full demonstration environment experience, aiming to bridge any knowledge gaps for our non-technical prospects while providing a clear and simple pathway towards understanding how to embed Qlik Sense in a multi-tenant SaaS application platform. A key outcome for using this demonstration asset is to mitigate potential risk early in the sales cycle, build enthusiasm/interest for Qlik Sense and its capabilities, and showcase our readiness to support the customer or partner’s vision for embedding analytics within their application suite.

This prospect experience is supported by several linked assets. We have a demo website which simulates the SaaS platform of an OEM partner, including videos and documentation illustrating each integration topic and a presentation taking the audience through a journey which highlights key aspects of Qlik Sense, its APIs and the overall value of Qlik.",,,,,,,,,

When embedding Qlik Sense in your platform, there are several integration topics to handle:
 - Data: Load your data in a Qlik Sense app. The data can be a combination of different data sources. Qlik Sense has a range of connectors that allow you to analyze ALL your data in a Qlik Sense App. While loading the data, you have the possibility to create an optimized associative data model. That model is then loaded in the memory when the app opens. With direct discovery you can also your real time SQL queries. Also incremental or delta loads are possible in order to reduce the reload time.
 - Security: When Qlik Sense is embedded, normally Single Sign-On must be provided for authentication. After that, authorization must be applied (What can a user see and what rights does he have?). Qlik Sense offers a flexible and robust security rule system to setup authorization. The good thing is that users, roles, groups,…. that are already defined in your SaaS platform, can be re-used in Qlik Sense.
 - Web: Qlik Sense is built on the newest web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS). This allows you to create 1 app that can be easily integrated in your SaaS platform. This can be with IFrame, and using our APIs for DIV tag embedding or using Qlik Sense for the data. Qlik Sense is also completely responsive. So there is no need to create mobile content. 1 App can be used on all platforms.
 - SaaS provisioning: Our APIs allow the automatic creation of customer content. Creation of Apps and streams, replacing the script with user specific script, copying apps, … can all be done automatically.
 - Architecture : Our server system allows clustering, scaling and high availability.
 - Dashboard: Qlik Sense offers a wide array of beautiful visualizations in order to show your data as you want it. With the open standard of Qlik Sense it is very easy to download or create additional visualizations. With our drag and drop and scalability possibilities it is very easy to create a beautiful and powerful dashboard.",,,,,,,,,

The left side of the screen will show the 'broker'. This is a software capability that is already in place and manages the current SaaS platform. This piece of software will maintain the control of the SaaS platform and will communicate with our Sense platform through our APIs. This means that the control stays completely in the existing platform.

In this demo, the broker will define following parameters:
 - Which customers need access to the applications?
 - What will be the roles and the access rights to the apps?
 - Which apps should be provided?

On the right side of the screen, the result of the activities of the broker will be shown:
 - Which streams were created.
Which apps were copied and published.",,,,,,,,,

<p> This demo shows you how to copy an app (dashboard) which serves as a ""template layout"" for each of your customers. Besides creating a copy, we will also reload the app with data from the customer database.

 In the demo you will see a screen divided into two parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The left side shows ""the broker"" in your SaaS platform, a piece of software that you already use today to mass maintain the SaaS applications for all of your customers. This broker executes its activities based on the list of your customers, their access rights, and the relevant template apps (depending on what the customer has configured in your platform).</li>
                            <li>The right side shows you the result of the activities of the broker: the apps and streams automatically created in Qlik Sense.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In order to finish the demo, you must complete the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Select your customers</b>. In your SaaS platform you have the ability to store which customers should receive which apps. We simulate this feature by letting you select the customers. By pressing the button, you also select an ""app"" to be used as a template for the layout.</li>
         <li><b>Select your apps</b> Which apps do your customers need to receive?</li>
                            <li><b>Press generate</b>, This will make a copy of the template app for each of your customers. It replaces the generic script with a customer specific one and reloads the app. Because you are able to insert a custom script, you can also specify specific data models like custom fields and tables or create them them on the fly in order to connect to big data sources. In the end we make a unique stream for each customer and publish the app into this stream.</li>
                            <li><b>Select a user and press the green button.</b> This allows you to test the single sign on and make sure that each customer can only see their own data (streams and apps). You can also test row level security by opening the ""row level security"" app in the ""everyone stream"". This demonstrates that each user only sees the values pertaining to the country of their group membership.</li>

A user can be a computer or a human. What defines a user is the fact that it has a userID, that it belongs to a certain customer and that it has one or multiple groups. When that user logs on to the SaaS platform, he is authenticated.  At the point he needs to see Qlik Sense content, that user needs to be authenticated with Qlik Sense. At this point this information is passed through by means of a ticket. (There are other methods, but here we use ticketing). This ticket contains the userID and additional attributes ( like groups, specific script content,….). On this website thery are stored in a Mongo Database. Through APIs these can be fetched and passed to Qlik Sense. Based on the userID and group(s) the correct content will be shown and the user will have the correct rights based on the group membership.",,,,,,,,,

This slide shows the process of an app generation when a user logs in to the SaaS platform:
 - A user logs in on the SaaS platform.
 - In the SaaS platform a user is automatically connected to the Qlik Sense Hub, embedded in the SaaS platform via an IFrame or a DIV tag integration.
 - Through Single Sign On, the user will be automatically connected to the Qlik Sense platform . This is done through ticketing. The ticket contains the userID and the group(s) of the user. 
Based on this information and through APIs, the correct apps and streams will be created in Qlik Sense and be provisioned to the user. ",,,,,,,,,

Integration.qlik.com has 3 servers running:
 - QRSMeteor server: This server runs on port 3000. This server hosts the admin panel that acts as the broker. Through this server the administration of the SaaS platform is being managed. (Adding customers and users, which apps should be provisioned,…)
 - Sense web integration: This server runs on port 3030. This is a webserver in where we are embedding our Qlik Sense environment.
 - Qlik Sense server: This server runs on port 443. This server contains all the Qlik Sense content that needs to be provisioned. (apps, app objects, streams). This server interacts with the 2 other servers. It interacts  with the QRS meteor server trough API calls. The QRS meteor server will send these calls in order to copy, reload and publish apps, create streams,…
It also interacts with the Sense web integration. The user needs to see its embedded content in the SaaS environment, through IFrame or DIV tag integration. Through Single Sign On the correct content will be shown.",,,,,,,,,

#Some basic principles in setting up SaaS provisioning with Qlik Sense:
 - Create 1 or multiple template apps per business or process area. This way the different apps are easy maintainable and grouped. Also administrator(s) per area can maintain their specific content. A template app contains about 80% of all layout, sheets and charts.
 - Apps can be manually created through the Qlik Sense Hub or through an API call. (Our APIs work all with a JSON structure).
 - When the template app will be copied to make the customer specific one, the customer specific data must be loaded in the app. A modification must be made to the script to made it customer specific. Most of the time only the database connection must be changed  as most of the customers will have the same structure in tables and fields. All this customer specific data is already stored in a database.
 - The modification of the script can be done through APIs. 
There is also a possibility of using and INCLUDE file: This is an external file that contains customer specific script.

# To summarize:  
In the end you want that all your customers will get their own app with their own data.
For this we use a piece of software that regulates your SaaS platform, or a broker. On the Qlik Sense server we have already our template apps. These are apps that already have a script, data model and layout ready. Whenever we need to provision an app the following steps happen: 
 - A stream is created with the name of the customer.
 - A copy of the template app will be made with the name of the customer.
 - Some script is inserted or modified to make sure the correct data is loaded.
 - The app is reloaded,
 - The app gets published in the correct stream.",,"","","","","         0","0","PreSales",

API stand for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.
A common language JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation) is being used for communication between the different APIs.",,,,,,,,,

So, what are the steps of requesting data through a SaaS platform? In the SaaS platform, we want to see the sum of sales by country. This request will be done from the SaaS platform where Qlik Sense is embedded. At the point we want to see our Qlik Sense data (this can be a Qlik Sense object or just the raw data) an API call is done to the Qlik Sense system.  
 For example: if there is already a bar chart that shows the sum of the sales by country, an API request is done to Qlik Sense to open the correct app and another request to get the correct object that must be shown in the SaaS platform. Before that, Qlik Sense needs to know who did the request, so authentication of the user must also be executed. For this we use another API that communicates with our Proxy.

# What is the power of the APIs with Qlik Sense.
 - With the APIs you can embed Qlik Sense in an existing web platform.
 - The possibility to create new objects or functionalities that are now available out of the box.
 - Creation of extra layers around the QMC.
 - Trough the APIs all the manual actions through the QMC can be automated.
 - Different systems can be connected and information shared.
 - Our Qlik Sense Proxy can be approached with APIs to ensure Single Sign-On between systems.
 - Authorization from the SaaS platform can be re-used  and communicated with the Qlik Sense platform.",,,,,,,,,

# To get started with APIs there are some key components that must be known:
 - First of all, APIs will be used to let 2 systems communicate with each other. The Qlik Sense APIs are used in an existing SaaS platform that runs on a webserver. So those 2 platforms must be able to pass information.
 - In order to use Single Sign On, the user needs to logon to the SaaS environment. At this point the login data of that user must be passed to the Qlik Sense system to guarantee the correct data will be available. That means that both systems must use an authentication method that can be used by both systems. Qlik Sense supports different types of authentication: Windows authentication, ticketing, header authentication, JSON Web Token and SAML authentication.
 - In order to program the APIs you'll need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). You are free to use which one you want. Qlik Sense Desktop and Enterprise comes with an IDE to get you started. This is our Development Hub and is accessible through the Qlik Sense Hub. This IDE is mainly used for testing purposes.
 - To maintain your code and versions, it is strongly advisable to use a source version control system. GITHUB is one of the most well know systems. Click on the link to be redirected to GITHUB.
In order to program the APIs, knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON is required.",,,,,,,,,

# Introduction to hostnames/DNS
 - DNS ( Domain Name Server): 
Is the Internet's equivalent of a phone       book. They maintain a directory of 
domain names and translate them to 
 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
 - FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): 
 This is the complete domain name for a specific computer (or host) on the Internet. It consists out of 2 parts: the hostname and the domain name.
 - Internal server address: This is the address your server gets in the internal environment or domain.
 - External server address: This is the address your server has outside of the domain. Eg. If someone wants to login from Internet into a secure environment, it needs the address of the server.",,,,,,,,,

This slide gives an overview of the steps of an API call form a SaaS platform to Qlik Sense. In this example there is no need for authentication. At the point when some Qlik Sense data must be shown (here list of countries) in the SaaS platform (When a user arrives at a HTML page where Qlik Sense is embedded), the JavaScript fires an API request to the Qlik Sense server. The server will respond by giving the requested data.

This slide shows the same steps as the previous slide, but here there is a need for authentication. This means, before we can get the Qlik Sense data, the Qlik Sense server needs to know what user made the request. This process is called authentication. 
Normally, the user has already been authenticated by the SaaS platform. So through APIs, it is really easy to pass the identification and parameters of that user from the SaaS platform to Qlik Sense. So there is no need for an additional login screen to get to Qlik Sense. This is called SSO (Single sign on). The Qlik Sense proxy is the service that will handle the process of authentication.

In this example you see the different steps of a HTTP request to open a webpage.
 - A user will open his browser and put in an address of a website (in the example Qlik.com).
 - Through the HTTP protocol, a request will be done to the webserver to show the website. In order to request the data, a GET request is used.In the case of Qlik.com, the user does a request though the HTTP protocol that says: GET Qlik.com. 
 - The webserver will respond to the browser and will show the requested website.

In a more conceptional way: 
- The user sends a request for a webpage to a webserver. 
- The webserver analyses the request (in the http protocol) and will create the corresponding response. 
- After the response has been created, the webserver sends the response back to the client (browser). 
- The browser interprets the answer and displays the result.",,,,,,,,,

# A detailed overview of what happens when a user opens a website: 
- The user wants to browse to Qlik.com. For this in the browser a URL is used.
- The HTTP request uses the method GET to ask for the content of the website to be displayed. 
- To request this, the HTTP protocol is used where the URL of the website is put as a parameter.
These 3 steps are the processes of the client that will be used in the request for the server. 

- The server receives the request. Based on that it will create a corresponding response. In the case of asking for a web page, it will create a response that will have the correct content. (HTML pages, Image links, CSS files, JavaScript)
 - When the response is ready, the server sends the response back to the client.
These 2 steps are server side processes: Creating the response and sending it back to the client. 

- As a last step, the client will interpret the response: It will show the correct content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and also the data in the webpage. The data is delivered in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is a lightweight data-interface format. It is easy for humans to read and write and very easy for machines to parse and write. Responses of APIs are often always in JSON format.",,,,,,,,,

A user wants to see a list of apps through his browser.  
Through our API , a HTTP GET REST call can be used against our Qlik Sense system.
REST stands for  Representational State Transfer. It provides a way of using 'verbs ' between 2 systems. The GET statement means to fetch a resource or data. In the end this should be shown. It's like when you enter a website through a URL. When the website is loading, multiple GET requests will make sure the page is displayed with all its content.
In the same way a request can be fired to Qlik Sense and request data: in this case a full list of applications through our Repository API.
Our system will send a HTTP response back in JSON format with a list of all the apps.",,,,,,,,,

#This flow gives more information of what methods are used with REST APIs.
 - The user wants to go to a certain webpage. Whenever the search starts on a certain URL the JavaScript of the browser will activate to create a request. This is done through REST (Representational State Transfer). It is a way of communicating between a client -server system. It uses a list of HTTP methods:
  - GET: Is a request to retrieve information.
  - POST: Is a request that the resource at the URI does something with the provided entity. POST is often used to create a new entity, but it can also be used to update an entity. 
  - PUT: Is a request that stores an entity at a URI. PUT can create a new entity or update an existing one. There is a difference between PUT and POST: PUT is idempotent. Idempotent means that the same PUT request can be repeated, and it will always give the same result. POST is NOT idempotent. 
  - DELETE: Is a request that a resource be removed.  
- The webserver will interpret the URL of the website.
- A response will be created that will consist of different parts:  
 - JSON response for the data.  
 - HTML and CSS for the framework and style. These will be displayed in the browser 
- JavaScript: In order to make the website 'work' and interactive.

This slide gives an overview of the steps whenever a user wants to delete a list of apps trough the APIs.
 - Through the browser a REST HTTP protocol is used with the DEL method. The GUID of the apps are stored in the Qlik Sense Repository Database that  is maintained by the Qlik Sense Repository Services (QRS). Each app will get a unique GUID. So in order to delete the apps, the HTTP request is:DEL /qrs/app/' GUID of the apps.
 - After the Qlik Sense server has executed the request it will send a HTTP response with the response 200 (this means the request was executed successfully) to the client browser.

"API -  generic introduction","Async programming - What are the sequental steps when you order a pizza?","!comment
Programming with JavaScript means you will be programming asynchronous. Now what does that mean ?Well let's say you order a pizza in a restaurant. You first order a beer, and then order your pizza. Now your pizza must first be prepared, so you get a beeper that will notify you when it has been prepared. In the meanwhile you will do other things: drink your beer, have a chat with your companions, wash your hands,…In this example there are 2 possible branches that flow out of this scenario. The point here is that after your request, there is a wait. Unlike sequential programming where you do a request, you get the answer immediately after. JavaScript works differently. You will always need to wait after your request, like you must wait when your pizza is being prepared.

"API -  generic introduction","Async programming - What are the sequental steps when a computer orders a pizza?","!comment
Now let's take a look how the computer will order a pizza. The beginning of ordering is mainly the same as how a user orders a pizza. Now at the point that the pizza has been ordered, you will get a 'promise' object. You can see that object as your 'beeper'. So whenever a request is handled in JavaScript, a promise object will be created. In the meanwhile JavaScript will execute other parts of the code. It will not stop. When the request has been handled, a response will be given. So at that point the callback function or promise will be resolved. So this piece of code will be triggered whenever you have the answer on the request (ready or failed). In that piece of code you will put the code for the next steps. So in this example, whenever the beer has been resolved, you will drink your beer and when the pizza is ready, you will drink your beer again. Now what is the difference between callback and promises? 
 - A callback function is the function that will be used after a request has been resolved. But you can have multiple actions that need to be executed after your request. With callbacks, all these actions need to be nested while maintaining a very tight syntax with a collection of brackets. This can become very complex to write and maintain. Online you can find multiple examples of 'callback hell'. 
 - A promise is like the new generation of callbacks. In the end it will do the same as a callback, but whenever nested callbacks become very complex to write, you can write it through promises. It gives you a cleaner and easier way to write your callbacks.",,,,,,,,,

# This slide shows an example of generating a bar chart on  fly with our visualization API.
- The first part shows the config object. This is needed to know where the API needs to connect to get the data. The host is the hostname of the Qlik Sense Server. Is Secure is the parameter that decides that SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) should be used or not. The prefix tells to which Qlik Sense virtual proxy should be connected and through which port.
- The second part will create the bar chart with Qlik Sense Data.
  - **_Require(['js/qlik'], function(qlik_**):
  This will always appear at the beginning of you JavaScript code. This is necessary to use the Qlik API's.
  - **_Qlik.openApp_**: Here an API is used to open a Qlik Sense app. The first parameter is the GUID of the app. The second parameter refers to the config object.
  - **_App.visualization.create_**: This API will make a Qlik Sense visualization. The first parameter defines it is going to be a bar chart. The second parameters contains the Dimension(s) and Measure(s) for the bar chart. A lot of parameters can be defined here. In this example the bar chart will get the title: ""on the fly barchart"".
  - After that the bar chart is shown in a specific placeholder in de webpage.",,,,,,,,,

Most of the time the following scenario is used:
The employees will use Qlik Sense internally with full self service capabilities.They will also create the dashboards for other users. External users like customer and suppliers might need to see some data from Qlik Sense. They will login in a web portal and they will see only their relevant data. In that case Qlik Sense is embedded in the web environment. They will often have less or no self-service capabilities.

# In more detail
We can deliver embedded analytics to different user groups and audiences 
 
They can be residing in your back office covering all the internal processes in your organization - production, logistics, warehousing, sales, accounting, human resources management, etc.  They can reside in any of your customer facing team – any team member visible to including marketing, support or after-sales service teams.  
It’s also become even more important that we share data and information with the partners we work with. For example by sharing customer feedback on supplier products, this in-turn helps our suppliers understand better about their end customer - and heightens their awareness of the need for better innovations and improvements across the overall supply chain",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense you have the possibility to embed our hub, sheet, charts or use just the data.

# The technology used
One of the biggest advantages of Qlik Sense is the fact that an app can be used for all devices. Qlik Sense uses and supports a range of modern technologies:
- HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript: These technologies are used to embed Qlik Sense in a web environment. The HTML will define the frame of the webpage, CSS will style the page while JavaScript will take care of the behavior.
- RequireJS, AngularJS: These frameworks are being used by Qlik Sense and can be easily reused in the web environment.
- JSON is the language being used to communicate with our engine and other services.
- The way Qlik Sense communicates with its own and other services is done through the WebSocket protocol.
- CANVAS is being used to create visualizations.
- REST is being used to make sure the APIs are working correctly.",,,,,,,,,

"Web integration","Embed Qlik Sense: Which options do you have to embed the resources?","!comment
There are a couple of options for embedding. It depends on your requirements which one is the best option for you. Do you want to re-use what Qlik created for you or do you want to have full control over the look and feel? If you re-use our client you can be sure you will have a quick implementation but you have less customization flexibility. If you only use our charts you will have to create the website and buttons and other navigation aspects yourself and you will loose capabilities which are only available in the Qlik Sense client (out of the box) like the self service client, bookmarks and story telling. Note that you can build most features also yourself if you use our [APIs](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/September2017/Content/APIs-and-SDKs.htm). 
 
# IFrame
A very easy method of embedding the Hub, App, Sheet or an object. Basically with an IFrame you embed another document in the current HTML document. You can embed a maximum of 3 iframes in your DOM.
## When to use?
- Speed of deployment is key. 
- The look and feel of Qlik Sense suits your needs. Note that you can always change most layout aspects using Qlik Sense [theming API](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/February2018/Subsystems/APIs/Content/CapabilityAPIs/ThemeAPI/ThemeAPI.htm). 
- In this way you can embed our complete (self service) client. 
- If you require more customization you can better look at the options below. Please prevent that you start modifying our standard client files, you will face the risk of support and upgrade challenges. 

# Div Tag:
An HTML page can have reserved spaces (or placeholders). These are defined with Div tags. With our Capability API's it is possible to put Qlik Sense objects (individual charts) in these Div tags.
## When to use?
- You have a read only scenario (no self service) and you want to embed Qlik Sense in an existing web page. You will have to create the buttons and all other aspects yourself using the client side APIs.

# On the fly
Instead of already creating an object in a Qlik Sense app and then using it in a HTML page, it is possible to create the object on the fly in the JavaScript of the web page. Through our visualization API we give you the possibility to generate charts or other objects on the fly. This gives you the possibility to only generate the charts or complete apps whenever a user logs in, giving you lots of flexibility.
## When to use?
- You don't want to create or load data up front in an app. Based on selections in your host applications you want to create a chart or app on the fly.

# Data only
You can also just take the data out of Qlik Sense and build your own front-end. You can use the Capabilities API or the Engine API directly to get an array of data and vizualize it using your own charting library, Qlik Sense [picasso.js](https://picassojs.com/examples.html) or any other. Note that the [https://integration.qlik.com](integration.qlik.com) site is build in this way...
## When to use?
- You want to use your own vizualizations and have full control over the HTML, javascript (enigmaJS) and CSS. Or you like to use Qlik Sense data but you don't have javascript. Since the Engine API is JSON RPC you can connect to it using any language. 
- You have a read only scenario and don't need to use the self service client. Or you are willing to create this functionality using the APIs.",,,,,,,,,

"Web integration","Options to embed Qlik Sense: from simple to advanced use cases","!comment
Through our  'Embedding Qlik Sense' demo on integration.qlik.com, you will notice we have embedded  different parts of Qlik Sense.
On the left side of the screen you can choose which example you want to see. On the right side you will see the result.
Basically there are 3 main ways of embedding Qlik Sense:
 - Through an IFrame: This method allows to embed the full hub, a complete app, a complete sheets or a collection of multiple objects.
 It allows Qlik Sense to be embedded is a fast and easy way. When using IFrame you are using the layout and objects define in Qlik Sense.
 - With Div tags you have the possibility to embed individual objects in a web page.  A Div tag is nothing more than a reserved place on a webpage. This allows you to make a customized webpage, that used Qlik Sense object.
- Finally you can use Qlik Sense APIs to provide the data. In the JavaScript charts can be built on the fly through our API or  external visualizations (Eg. D3 charts)",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense Enterprise you have all the possible options to embed. The Enterprise edition also contains the hub and its corresponding menus, toolbars and buttons. This makes it possible to also use these in your embedding. When choosing the Qlik Analytics Platform (QAP) you have all the same possibilities, except the whole visual layer. This means there is no hub, app overview, menu, toolbars,.. So with the QAP you can only embed sheets (without menu), objects and data on the fly.",,,,,,,,,

# An overview of the key APIs
 - Re-use: If you want to reuse Qlik Sense components in your website. This can be the hub, an app, a sheet or objects. For this DIV tags or IFrame are used.
 - On the fly: This means that apps, data or objects are only created or provisioned whenever a customer logs in. This can be from creating an app on demand, only load in customer specific data, to creating a chart on the fly using HTML or JavaScript code.
 - Extend: With our collection of APIs you can make chart types that were not out of the box available, but act as native Qlik Sense objects. You can also add widgets to improve the look and feel of you Qlik Sense application. On [branch.qlik.com]\(qlik.branch.com) you can find a collection of third party extensions, free for download or you can add your own extensions there.
 - Data only: Instead of using Qlik Sense with its visual layer, only the  fast in-memory data warehouse of Qlik is used. Through API calls in JSON format you can create your own visual layer by using Qlik Sense as your backbone for data delivery and data associations.",,,,,,,,,

 - On the SaaS platform you have the webpage, consisting out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the HTML, the IFrame refers to a URL of Qlik Sense.
 - At the point that the HTML page is loaded, connection to the Qlik Sense server is needed. To get access to the server, the virtual proxy must be passed first (authenticating).
On the bottom of the screen there are 2 examples of IFrame URLs. The first one shows a sheet in an analysis state. The second one shows a sheet where a certain selection has been made.",,,,,,,,,

# Pro and con
## Pro
 - It is very easy to embed content in a page. There is no need of knowing specific or difficult HTML statements.
 - It is very simple to separate content onto several pages. A part of the page can stay static while other content can be dynamic
 - There is no collision between layout, CSS styles as it is a separate website.
## Cons
 - You do not have a single HTML page and the IFrame integrates another one in the current HTML page. So at least 2 of them need to be maintained, and code is separated. 
 - Sizing an IFrame is considerably more work.
 - Broken framesets might be an issue.

Qlik Sense capabilities APIs are a collection of JavaScript APIs that allows you to easily embed Qlik Sense content in a web page.
Our capability APIs are dependent on AngularJS and RequireJS. When integrating our APIs in an existing project, the same libraries must be used.
With our capability APIs existing visualizations of Qlik Sense can be used or created on the fly and can be embedded in a web page. But it goes further: Data, selections, bookmarks, variables,…. Can all be obtained and used.

Whenever you open a HTML page, a lot of things are being loaded in the background.In this overview you see that a user logs in to a SaaS platform. It contains several HTML pages which have to 'show' something. These can consist out of:
 - CSS: CSS is used to style the HTML page ( color, borders, sizing,…)
 - JavaScript: Is used for the behaviors of the page. For example: If you click on a button, the current selections must be cleared. That action is being executed in the JavaScript.
 - Images can be loaded.
Different fonts can be used and must be loaded also.",,,,,,,,,

Click on the link to go to the integration demo. The second part on the left side shows different examples using div tags.
The difference with an IFrame is that instead of embedding a full site, app or sheet, individual objects are embedded. Each object is placed in a placeholder. In the HTML code we used the Div tags as placeholders. In the demo there are different examples which can be viewed.

This slide shows the JavaScript example of using our capability APIs for integrating Qlik Sense objects into a webpage through Div tags.

First the Qlik Sense app needs to be opened to get to the content and objects that need to be embedded. This happens on the line of code that starts with 'var app':
The API qlik.openApp is used to create an object that gets access to the desired app.
The long number is the internal GUID of the app that is used in our Qlik Sense environment. The config object is used to make sure the right connection is made with the Qlik Sense Server.

Secondly there are 2 lines that start with 'app.getObject':
This API gets the GUID of the object ( the second parameter) and puts it in the desired placeholder (first parameter). These placeholders are defined in the HTML code of the web page with Div tags.

Click on the links on top to toggle between HTML, JavaScript, Resources, CSS and Result.

This code gives an example by using an API to make a selection in a certain field.In this case _app.field(fieldname).selectvalues([values])_
Is used. The field 'LastName' is used here and the value 'Jones' will be selected from it.
 - The first true parameter: is a boolean. If it's put on true it toggles the selected state.
 - The second true parameter: is a boolean. If it's put on true, locked selections can be overwritten.

The Host white list is a property on the Qlik Sense virtual proxies. In there the hostnames, IP addresses or subdomainsof the servers where Qlik Sense needs to connect to, can be entered.
Now in an integration example:  
First you have the webpages of the SaaS platform which contain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTTP origin header comes from the SaaS platform web server. Whenever Qlik Sense is embedded though IFrame or Div tags , it also uses web content which again uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But here the HTTP origin header comes from Qlik Sense.
Whenever the page on the SaaS platform is loaded, it will need the embedded content from Qlik Sense. To get to the content you always need to pass the Qlik Sense virtual proxy. If the virtual proxy does not know the address, hostname,… of the server then there will no WebSocket connection allowed. The page will not load in the Qlik Sense content.  
When an additional header is supplied, the address needs not to be added to the whitelist : Access-Control-Allow-Origin *. Instead of using *, use your protocol, server, port combination.

#This slide gives an overview which steps are executed to use our Capabilities API.  
1. The user is authenticated in the SaaS platform and arrives on a web page with embedded Qlik Sense objects through our Capabilities API in the JavaScript. 
2. In order to show the Qlik Sense content, the user must be authenticated in the Qlik Sense system. So first of all there has to be an authentication check through a Qlik Sense virtual proxy. (Most of the time this is done through ticketing or HTTP header). If the user fails the authentication check, a WebSocket error will occur. 
3. If the authentication was successful, the Require.JS starts. This is a module loader that loads in all the required components in the right order to make sure the Qlik Sense objects can be loaded. These components are Qlik.js, the client-CSS and fonts. 
4. When these are loaded, it is important that the right objects are shown. First authorizing happens. This is done by our security rules. If a certain user does not have access to a certain app or object the Qlik Sense content will not be shown in the embedded HTML page.
Finally Section Access is used to make sure row level security is executed.",,,,,,,,,

#This slide gives an overview which steps are executed when a page with mashups is shown:
In the existing SaaS platform there are webpages. They consist out of:
 - HTML with Div tags where Qlik Sense objects are embedded. 
 - CSS for the styling.
 - JavaScript to use our APIs to embed the Qlik Sense objects in the Div tags.  
When the page is shown, the user must be authenticated first. So a authentication check is done through our virtual proxy . (Most of the time this is done through ticketing or HTTP header). If the user fails the authentication check, a WebSocket error will occur.  
After the user is authenticated the Qlik Sense engine will provide the corresponding objects. Authorization through our security rules will determine if the user has access to the correct stream(s) and app(s). At that point there can be a choice to use an existing chart, to create a new one on the fly using our Visualizations API or to simply get the data from the app. (That data can be used in a third party visualization). In order to show only the correct data, Section Access is applied.",,,,,,,,,

JavaScript is a vast collection of different libraries and frameworks, each with their own set of requirements.
Require.js is a framework that loads in the required pieces of software (called packages or modules) in the correct order as certain frameworks are dependent of others. Qlik Sense uses a modified version Require.js. Certain pieces of code have been added to make sure all our APIs work properly.
(At the beginning of the JavaScript code of a mashup, you will always see the following line: _require( [""js/qlik""], function ( qlik )_. This is the call for the Qlik required framework).   
This modified version of Qlik is not the same as the default require.js. In order to make sure Qlik Sense works properly, your web platform MUST use the same version of require.js as the version that ships with Qlik Sense. If not the mashup will fail to work.

This code shows 2 ways of creating Qlik Sense visualizations on the fly:
 - Through our APIs _app.visualization.create_:   This API will make a Qlik Sense visualization. The first parameter defines it is going to be a bar chart. The second parameters contains the Dimension(s) ( in this case 'Country)' and Measure(s) ( in this case '=sum(LineSalesAmount)'for the bar chart.   After the creation, the bar chart is shown in the designated Div placeholder.
 - Through visuals web components: This way there is no need for JavaScript. First the correct app is opened.  After that the type of the chart is chosen (here a barchart).
Finally the columns are defined: '[Case Owner Group]' as dimension and '=Avg([Case Duration Time])' as measure.  
The chart gets the title: 'on the fly barchart'.",,,,,,,,,

This method is used whenever a user or company wants to maintain their own look and feel/house style (colors, fonts, specific customized visualizations,…) or the user has already a full library of its own visualizations and wants to use those.  
As said on the previous slide, it gives the users the possibility to create their own visual layer while maintaining the associative power of Qlik Sense. This means that ALL the data will be completely visual at ALL times. Through the communication of the SaaS platform and Qlik Sense through WebSockets, your data keeps in sync. Selections can be made as in a native Qlik Sense visualization. As the data is connected, all the other visualizations or object will react to the selections.
Really the sky is the limit here: The possibility to create a completely customized visual layer on the associative Qlik Sense model.

With the Table API it is possible to retrieve any combination of dimensions and measures. In the code, first the correct app is opened to have access to the dataset. After that the _app.createTable_ API is used to create the data table on the fly. In this example the table has 2 dimensions: 'Country' and 'City' and 1 measure : 'Sum(LineSalesAmount)'. The rows parameter defines the maximum rows of the table.  
At the end the result will be shown with an onData event.",,,,,,,,,

"Web integration","Performance tips","When you call `close` all scopes will be destroyed and if it still has a DOM reference that node will be removed from the page.

So if the function that you shared is called every time they flip between the panels in the end you will have a lot of active visualization models.

Which all will react to every selection you make in the app and start fetching data even though they aren't rendering anything to the screen.

That's usually the main culprit when people experience that the app gets slow over time. (Source: Alexander Karlsson)",,,,,,,,,

First of all it is really important to understand the difference between authentication and authorization. Let's use the following example:   You arrive at work and you start up your computer. Before you can use it, you need to give in a username and password. That process is called authenticating. By entering your unique user and password the computer knows who you are, and lets you enter. Authenticating is used constantly: unlocking your smartphone, logging on to your amazon account,…. Authentication is like asking: 'Who are you?' and is often the first step in a security model.  
Let's go back to the example of logging on to your work computer. After you are logged in you need certain files of your department to work in. You go to the place where they are stored and get the required files. You notice that you can only see and modify the files of YOUR department, not of the other departments. This is called authorizing.  
Authorization is asking: 'I know who you are, now what can you do?'.",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense, the control is fully kept. Typical problems like unreliable and slow reporting, different versions of the truth, performance issues ,… are handled with Qlik Sense:  
Qlik Sense security is so flexible it can completely plugin in the existing security framework. In addition with our Security rules and row level security (Section Access) we can give the right content to the right users and developers. Every user will have its correct rights. That means that end users will only be able to analyse, but developers can maintain their apps real-time, so that modifications can be done very fast. So it's always necessary to make sure there is an authorization concept design made.

This slide gives an example of an authorization concept. It's a combination of certain rules a certain user or group can execute. Qlik Sense is completely free and flexible to create security rules, so an initial design is strongly advised in order to build up a robust and easy security authorization system.

The next step after the functional design of the authorization, is the technical design. As Qlik Sense needs to plugin into an existing system, there are some key questions:
 - Where are the users stored? As we use the users that are already present in the current system.
 - Can existing groups be re-used outside of Qlik? These groups will be used in security rules to define what the self-service rights, roles,… can be. 
 - If the groups cannot be re-used, is it possible to create and assign groups or roles in Qlik Sense.",,,,,,,,,

Authentication (WHO are you?)  
This process is identifying who the user is that logs on. These can be:
 - Internal (domain) end users. For example the employees of a company.
 - External users (not in domain). For example some customers of the company.
 - External service (API) users (not in domain).
 - Sense service accounts. These are users that have been created by the Sense system and make sure the internal services run correctly and can communicate with each other.

The user's identity can be stored in a different set of systems. Traditionally users are stored in Active Directory or LDAP. (Qlik Sense supports Active directory out of the box). Users can also be store in other software systems like Facebook, Salesforce, HR systems,… It is also possible to store the data of the users in a traditional database or filetype (like Excel). For SaaS - OEM scenarios, the option to store the users in a database is preferred. It makes it very easy to inject that data into a ticket that can be passed on to our Qlik Sense system.

"Security - technical design","Qlik Sense options to authenticate","!comment
Qlik Sense has different options for authentication. You can create as many virtual proxies as you want, each with their own specific method of authenticating. The following authentication methods are supported:
 - Microsoft authentication (Local Windows directory or Active directory). This is one of the most common methods to authenticate. For Qlik Sense it is also the easiest: When a Qlik Sense Enterprise is installed, it authenticates by default against AD.
 - Ticketing. This method is used a lot in integration and SSO (Single Sign On) scenarios. A user is already authenticated in another software, but needs to see embedded Qlik Sense content. A ticket is passed to the virtual proxy of Qlik Sense. The ticket contains all the necessary information of the user ( ID, name, group,…)
 - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). Also used for SSO. It is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider.
 - Headers. This method is used for SSO and integration scenarios. The ID and additional information of the user is parsed in the HTTP(S) header.
 - JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for secure transmission of information between two parties as a JavaScript Object Notation or JSON object. JWT is used for authentication and authorization. Because JWT enables single sign-on (SSO), it minimizes the number of times a user has to log on to cloud applications and websites.  
Certificates are used for communication between different servers so that it is completely secured.",,,,,,,,,

With Qlik Sense you do not need different machines with different proxies with authentication methods. In Qlik Sense, virtual proxies are created that all can run on the same machine. Each virtual proxy has its own authentication method and is linked to a proxy. 
Whenever a user needs data form Qlik Sense in an embedded environment, our API includes the name or prefix of which virtual proxy needs to be used and is redirected to a specific proxy path.",,,,,,,,,

Authorization in Qlik Sense is mainly handled by the security rules. These security rules are very customizable and flexible. In order to make a robust security rule set, it is important to know some relevant resources. 
- Context: A rule can be made in a certain context. There are 3 contexts available: Hub, QMC or Both. Context is a way to split the rules between the QMC (Management Console) or The Qlik Sense Hub. Some resources can exist in the 2 resources (For example Apps, Streams, App Objects). Then you use the 'Both' option on the resource.
- Stream: A stream can be compared to a folder. A stream will contain 1 or multiple apps. In order to present Qlik Sense apps to end users, the apps must be put in a stream. That process is called publishing an app. If an app is not published, it will appear in the 'My Work' stream of the owner and it will only be available to the owner.
 - App: An app consists out of multiple app objects : sheets, stories, bookmarks, dimensions, measures. On the sheets multiple objects can be placed (Charts, tables, KPI objects,…) to show the data.",,,,,,,,,

"Security - technical design","Security flow: User opens an app","!comment
When a user wants to display an embedded app in his web environment, a whole process is started to make sure the user sees the correct content.  
The first step is the authentication part:  
A connection to a virtual proxy of Qlik Sense is made. There are different methods of authentication (Windows, Ticket, header, SAML, JWT).  

When the user is authenticated the second step starts: authorization.  
This is handled mainly by the security rules of Qlik Sense. The levels that are being checked are:  
Does the user have stream access? If yes, does he have access to the app in the stream? If yes does he have app object access? (stream, story, bookmark). 
If these requirements are met, the last part of authorization comes into play. The row level security or section access is defined in the data load editor of the app. When the app is opened the section access will activate and show only the right data subset in the app.

The user logs in and goes to our server or the Qlik Sense hub. First of all the user must be known, so authentication must be done. This is done by our Qlik Sense Proxy (QPS). Then the user gets authenticated. If there is no cookie present yet, the proxy redirects the request to an authentication module. It will request a ticket for the user and group membership. In order to get the required data, there is a UDC (User Directory Connector) used. A UDC creates a link to the database of the identity provider to be able to get the required user data. When this is done, the user is redirected to the hub, with a ticket appended in the URL of the request. The proxy will grant access. After that the correct content will be shown through our security rules. And finally , to see the correct data in an app, section access is executed.

"Security - technical design","Qlik Sense security flow when opening an app","!comment
This slide gives an overview of all the security processes when opening an app.
- The user starts from the browser and needs to see Qlik Sense content.
- First of all the Qlik Proxy Services (QPS) will need the user credentials to grant access. A connection to the Identity Provider will be made to verify this. By default Qlik Sense will authenticate against Active Directory, but other authentication methods are possible. When the user credentials are correct, the proxy will create a session. This whole process is the authentication part of Qlik Sense. 
- After that, the right content must be shown. This is handled by the security rules in Qlik Sense. To make sure that Qlik Sense knows the IDs and attributes of the users, UDC(s) (User Directory Connector) are created to make sure that this information is known in Qlik Sense. The security rules, UDC's and user data are stored in the Repository Database of Qlik Sense. That database is maintained by the Qlik Repository Services (QRS). This is the first step of authorization. 
- Now the correct content is available for the user. To make sure that the app shows the correct sub data set, Dynamic data reduction or Section Access is used. This is a specific script that is made in the app itself. It is executed when the app is opened. The Qlik Engine Service (QES) is the service that hosts the apps so it also executes the Section Access. This is the second part of authorization.",,,,,,,,,

To pass through the user information from the SaaS platform to Qlik Sense, often ticketing is used.
- A user logs in to the SaaS platform. At this point the user is authenticated in the SaaS platform. It is important to know that Qlik Sense will not store the list of users again. All the users and authorizations are stored in the security module of your SaaS platform.
- At a point, the user will arrive on a web page in the SaaS platform that has Qlik Sense content that must be shown.
- The user is redirected to the Qlik Sense Proxy that has a Virtual Proxy that will authenticate against a ticket. The user credentials have been verified when the user logged in on the SaaS platform so the authentication module will request a ticket form the Qlik Sense Proxy.  - The proxy will send a ticket to the authentication module. 
- The authentication module will redirect the user back to the Qlik Sense Proxy with a ticket. The proxy checks if the ticket is valid and has not timed out.
-  If the ticket is still valid, the proxy will create a session for the user and the user is authenticated.
- The Qlik Sense content is available.",,,,,,,,,

"Security - technical design","Qlik Sense security overview","!comment
There are some basic concepts that Qlik Sense uses in its security:
- Streams, Apps, Sheets: A Stream is like a folder where apps are stored. In order to provision an app to users, it must always be published in a stream. The app is a container with the Data(model), sheets with visualisations, Dimensions, Measures, Bookmarks and Stories. Normally security is implemented on stream level. It is very easy to give each customer its own stream and apps. But it is also possible to implement security on app or sheet level.
- Security rules: The security rules use ABAC (Attribute Base Access control).  A rule always uses this concept: 
 Allow the USER to do ACTION on the RESOURCE in ENVIRONMENT provided CONDITION . 
- Roles and groups: These need not to be created in Qlik Sense. In order to use them in the security rules, they can be re-used from the existing SaaS platform. Whenever a user needs Qlik Sense content, he needs to be authenticated. Often a ticket is used in order to authenticate. In that ticket the userid and group(s)are added, so that these can be used in the evaluation of the security rules and section access in Qlik Sense.
- Section Access: This part of security is in the script of the app. It offers row and column based security in the app. Whenever a user opens an app, its userid is checked. The user will only see his subset of the data, defined in the Section Access part.",,,,,,,,,

As said before, the authorization of Qlik Sense has 2 steps: 
 - Resource authorization: This is the first step of authorization. First of all, the user must see the correct content and resources: What Streams, apps, app objects, … does he have access to? This is all defined with the security rules in Qlik Sense.
 - Section Access: This second step will put a data filter on an app, so that the correct data is shown.  For example, when the Sales manager of Europe accesses the app, he/she will only see the data from the Europe region. When the Sales manager from America opens the same app, he/she will only see the data form the Americas. This is called row level security.",,,,,,,,,

Let's take a look at the concept of security rules: 
Allow the USER to do ACTION on the RESOURCE in ENVIRONMENT provided CONDITION .

- Action/Conditions: These are the actions that can be used in creating a rule. Some of the actions are only available for administrators (Change owner, change role). Some actions can only be used against a certain resource (Publish can only be used with the resource stream, as you cannot publish an app in another resource).

- Resources: These are the components where you can use an action on. There are resources on the Hub and on the Management Console(QMC). Depending on where you want your rule to be applied on, you must choose the correct context with the correct resource. Each context has some specific resources. Some resources are also available on both contexts (for example Streams). ",,,,,,,,,

When the app is opened, the script in the Section Access part will be used in order to see what user has access to what dataset. There are 2 levels of access in Section Access:
 - ADMIN: Users in this access level will see all the data

Section access will restrict the data in an app. A table is loaded or created in the script in a part that is identified by Section Access. This table has some fields that are necessary to make the data reduction work:
 - ACCESS: This field can have 2 values. ADMIN access gives full access to all the data. USER will used for users with restricted subsets.
 - USERID: This contains the userid of the user that needs to use the data of the app. In an embedded scenario this is most of the times passed by a ticket.
 - GROUP: The name of the group or role a certain user is member of. This is used to create the row level security on group level. This parameter can also be included in a ticket.
 - OMIT: This field contains names of fields that need to be omitted from a certain user. So instead of reducing rows, it is also possible to reduce columns.  
This table in the section access part will not appear in the data model of the app. This table only will make sure a user can open the app or not.

By adding another table that links a field from the section access table to a certain field from the data model, a link is created between the section access table and the data model. Whenever the app opens these tables will act as a 'filter' and only the associated data is  shown. 
The example on the slide shows that certain users can see specific orders and their associated data. The field AUTH_EMP_ID field is used for this.",,,,,,,,,

This slide shows an example: 
The first example shows a Section Access Table: 
The field TERRITORYCODE is being used to link certain users to a certain territory from the data model. This will act as a filter and will only show the corresponding territory and its associated data to a user. 
The OMIT field has been filled with the value 'population' for all the Access type users. This means that they will never see the population data for ANY territory.

The code shows 3 tables:
 - The first table in the Section Access part allows user1 and user2 to open the app. They have their designated group1 and 2. There is also an admin user.
 - The second table in the section access part is used to hide several fields from group 1 and 2.  
The last table is in the Section Application part of the app. This table links a field from the Section Access part to a value from the data model form the app.",,,,,,,,,

Instead of using the USERID to make row level security, it might be easier to create the code based on groups. These groups are attributes of the user that can be passed through a ticket. This code shows that the first 3 users will have their designated groups (in this case countries). So it is very easy to link the GROUP field of the section access table to the country field in the dataset to apply the row level security. The last 3 users are administrators and they can see all the groups.

# Left: Your SaaS Platform
Your SaaS platform is represented on the left. 
## Client side 
Here you have your website running inside the browser of a computer or mobile phone of the user. In this browser the HTML will render the page (it provides placeholders for content). The CSS will do the colors and the layout, and the Javascript is responsible for all the interactivity. For example, if you press a selection button in your site, the Javascript will connect to the client side Sense APIs and make a selection. This is what we call a client side API call. The user is already authenticated in your Platform, and (somehow) has already received a Qlik Sense cookie. Therefore Qlik Sense knows who you are, and to which apps and data you have access to. Using Javascript we can automate all the activities a user would normally do. 

# Server side
Some use cases should only be done by users with special admin privileges. An example is the Single Sign on process. Only the service user of your SaaS platform should be allowed to request access for a user to Qlik Sense. Another example of server to server API calls are the execution of all activities related to the setup of your platform. For example in the integration.qlik.com demo, our server side tool inserts the license, creates apps, templates and uploads extensions etc.  It is common to use a Qlik Sense certificate for the authentication. You can get this ticket by exporting it in the QMC, and storing it on your SaaS platform. Next you will provide this certificate which each call you make. 

# On the right: Qlik Sense
## Front end focused 
Automate things on behalf of an end user 
- Open app 
- Make selection 
- Get chart or data 
- Create an app/chart on the fly

## Server side focused
- Authentication via QPS API:  login user (provide Single Sign On via a ticket request) 
- Administration (QMC) like activities via QRS API, (insert  or modify configuration, licenses, security rules, apps)
- Note that the engine API can be used for everything inside an app, so it can be seen as both relevant for front as well as back-end activities. If you have Javascript you can use EnigmaJS, for .NET you can use the .NET SDK or you can use any JSON RPC tool to talk directly to the engine API. But be aware this is a ""lower level API"" so the use of EnigmaJS is recommended. ",,,,,,,,,

 The typical wishes of a SaaS platform provider can be summarized in 3 main goals:
 - Create within a multi-tenant SaaS platform environment embedded analytics within the core application.
 - A certain level of self-service analytics should be provided to the users. Some users can have full self-service while other can be limited.
 - Provide dashboards in a fully automated way to the customers and users with the correct levels of security in place.",,,,,,,,,

"QPS - Proxy API","Use ticketing without the extra redirect","Its possible to directly pass on a ticket the first time you make a call to a static asset in Qlik Sense. See the comment from Alex below
- if you do ticketing how it works is that you get a ticket from your auth module and then you fetch a static resource from behind the proxy such as the require.js file with `qlikTicket=<ticket value>` appended to the url. The proxy will see the ticket, validate it and consume the ticket and if it's a valid ticket it will send the resource back to the browser with a session cookie attached to the response. The browser will then append the session cookie to future requests and the proxy will see the session cookie and let the requests through",,,,,,,,,

So what does our portfolio look like today?

It starts with our platform and our unique associative engine, which is the key to how unique value to our customers.  The Associative Difference fundamentally addresses the weaknesses of query based approaches, allowing you to bring together all your data and explore it without the limitations of query-based tools.  This unique differentiator is at the heart of everything we do, from our products and solutions to the innovation we have just discussed.  It is also the foundation on which Qlik built the Qlik Analytics Platform, our offering that allows any developer to build any data driven application using the same foundation we built Qlik Sense on.  And, our platform is available seamlessly on-premise, in public or private clouds or in our own cloud.

Next, nothing is complete without data, and our capabilities around data are a key foundation for our platform and products.  Whether its big data or combinations of data from multiple sources, of all sizes, Qlik provides a unique solution.  In addition to connectivity to over 100 data sources as part of our Qlik Connectors portfolio, Qlik also provides Qlik DataMarket, our DaaS (data as-a-service) offering to customers, with access to 3rd party syndicated data for use directly within our solutions.  And, not only can we connect to almost any source, our associative engine brings together any number of sources without leaving data behind.

On top of this foundation of platform and data, we offer our analytics solutions.  Qlik Sense is our next-generation product for self-service oriented analytics, delivering a full range of data analytics capabilities for individuals, groups, and organizations.  Qlik Sense is offered in 3 flavors – a free desktop client, in our cloud, or as our enterprise server based solution.  We built Qlik Sense on the same underlying platform that any developer can use to build their own data-driven applications.  We also offer QlikView, our first-generation data discovery product for guided analytics apps and dashboards.

The figure above explains the key services of Qlik Sense.

The Qlik Sense services are the cornerstones of the Qlik Sense site architecture. The services can be deployed in different ways to suit different deployment purposes.

The Qlik Sense services are:

The Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS) manages persistence and synchronization of Qlik Sense apps, licensing, security, and service configuration data. The QRS attaches to a repository database and is needed by all other Qlik Sense services to run and serve Qlik Sense apps. The QRS also manages the synchronization used within multi-node Qlik Sense sites. In addition, the QRS stores the Qlik Sense app structures and the paths to the binary files (that is, the app data stored in the local file system).

In a default Qlik Sense installation, a Qlik Sense Repository Database (QRD) service is created specifically for use by the Qlik Sense Repository Service (QRS). The QRS connects to the QRD to read and write data in the repository database. A PostgreSQL database is used by default.

The Qlik Sense Proxy Service (QPS) manages the Qlik Sense site authentication, session handling, and load balancing.

The Qlik Sense Scheduler Service (QSS) manages the scheduled reloads of Qlik Sense apps as well as other types of reload triggering (for example, task chaining) based on other task events.

The Qlik Sense Engine Service (QES) is the application service, which handles all application calculations and logic.",,,,,,,,,

# Data Access Layer
The associative model combines data from all data sources. You are not limited to any join type or number of data sources. You will basically get a ""full outer join"" but now better. Normally you would get data quality issues (double rows, incorrect figures) and a massive performance impact. Qlik Sense does not face these common issues which you get with SQL based tools because of its patented Associative QIX engine. Next this we know that your data never first your reporting needs  as delivered by your source. Therefore we offer an extensive ETL toolset so you can shape your data to match your reporting requirements. Examples are: combining multiple tables to form neat entities (customer or employee tables), or combining budget and actuals into 1 model, or maybe you would like to create a history of facts from the source?

# Applications Layer
Qlik Engine holds the application into memory for end user consumption. Multiple users can share this model if needed to optimize performance, or the models can be phyiscally splitted from security rand performance reasons, you have a choice....

# Web Layer
Qlik Sense Enterprise (QSE) Platform provides access through the web based Qlik Hub. It shows the different applications and streams available to the user.
In the Qlik Management Console (QMC) you can administer the Qlik Sense Site based on the Qlik Governance approach. Using the security rules you can precisely define who can do which admin activities basedd on the authorizations from your source platform. You don't need to create or maintain access rights in Qlik Sense as well. 

Since Qlik Sense is web based you can also easily embed the hub, a sheet or any visualization into a portal. 

# Summary
Users of all types can easily create and analyze in Qlik Sense using a unified HTML5 web based client, with no necessity for browser plugins, apps or fat desktop clients.
IT can utilize a simple and powerful, web based management console (QMC) for administration developed with the same technologies as the front-end client.
Developers can integrate data and build analytics using the web client, and can extend and customize Qlik Sense through standard and open API’s

Qlik supports a variaty of Authentication providers such as LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, SAML, JWT and others.
Qlik provides Client and server side  REST and websocket based APIs to automate or interact with external processes.

Based on your requirements you can choose on how you would like to prioritize your setup. A big server in the front end and a smaller one in the back? Or do you prefer two servers serving end users? In the last case one server will also do back end activities like reloading the data. 

You can configure a Qlik Sense enterprise deployment in a variety of different ways to suit the needs of your organization. For example, you can install Qlik Sense services to run on a single node or on multiple nodes for better performance and scalability. In a small single-node deployment, you deploy all services to a single server, which we do not recommend for larger organizations.

# More detailed information
In the next slides you will see multiple options to configure Qlik Sense deployments.

The following terms are used in the deployment scenarios:

Central node: the central point for managing all nodes in a site.
- Scheduler or Reload node: reloads apps on a schedule, but does not serve content to users.
- Consumer node: serves apps to users, but is not used to create, process, or reload data.
- Development node: allows users to create and reload new apps, but does not serve normal consumer traffic.
- Proxy node: provides load balancing of user traffic to other nodes but does not contain a Qlik Sense Engine Service (QES).",,"","","","","         0","0","Hosting Ops",

Another way an on-premise solution is often exposed to the internet is to make Qlik Sense accessible through an 3rd party Enterprise Mobility Management – or EMM – solution.  In this case, Qlik Sense is made accessible via a browser like Safari, Chrome, or the EMM vendor’s secure browser and also leverages a device level or per app VPN.  Specific EMM vendors will be covered in subsequent modules, but in all cases, the EMM solution’s browser – if it is being used – and the EMM solution’s infrastructure must support websocket traffic.

In this scenerio have can have an unlimited number of users and customers/tenants in SaaS deployments. Your software (broker) creates a windows machine for each set of customers in the front end. This (clustered) front end machine reads the QVF file generated by the back-end from a shared folder. The back and front-end are different Qlik Sense sites. They don't share anything and as such have their own QMC. 

For example you can have 1000 customers on machine 1 and 1000 customers on machine 2 in the front. Machine 1 and 2 are also different Qlik Sense sites. So they have nothing in common. If you get another 10.000 customers you just spin up another x machines. All independent of each other. 

You will manage the whole configuration using the APIs. See the API chapters on integration.qlik.com for more information.

This diagram shows an example of Qlik Sense Enterprise (QSE) for elastic deployments with a single Kubernetes cluster connected to a Qlik Sense Enterprise node. The cluster contains one or more of the Qlik Sense microservices such as the Engine or other services deployed across a set of nodes. This deployment provides the ability to scale up the number of apps (read only) for user consumption. The Kubernetes cluster, which is deployed within a public or private cloud, shares data volumes and a MongoDB instance. An Identity Provider (IdP) authenticates users while QSE for elastic deployments authorizes access to multi-cloud apps using built-in security rules. The IdP allows the same named users to access content in Qlik Sense Enterprise and the cloud environment, subject to security rules. The Kubernetes cluster, public or private cloud, and network infrastructure are all managed by the customer.",,,,,,,,,

In QMC, go to Certificates section and export new certificates using the FQDN of the new server.
Be sure to include the Private key
We need the certificates to be in the Windows format
Record the UNC root path specified in the Service Cluster section in the QMC
Stop all services except for the Qlik Sense Repository Database
Create a new folder for the backup, e.g. C:\backup
Open MMC and Export the Trusted Root Certificate used by Qlik Sense from the Local Computer / Computer Account snap-in. And place it into the backup folder
Be sure to include the Private key
Take a backup of the database (relevant help link)
Sample command: ""C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin\pg_dump.exe"" -h localhost -p 4432 -U postgres -b -F t -f ""c:\backup\QSR_backup.tar"" QSR
Copy all subfolders in the UNC root specified in the Service Cluster Section in the QMC to the backup folder
Copy the Server certificate from the Exported Certificates folder to the backup folder (default: C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Exported Certificates)
Optional:
Zip the Backup folder for ease of transfer

# New Server
Install all Windows Updates
Update to the latest .NET Framework version
Verify that the C++ Redistributable is installed and patched
Visit help.qlik.com, click on your Sense software version, and verify that all pre-req's are met
Once all is complete, now you can install Qlik Sense on the new server (it has to be of the exact same version)
During the installation process uncheck the check box to start services after installation. We will want to do extra configuration before Qlik Sense initializes
Transfer the backup from the old server to local disk on the new server
While the installer is working:
Import the Trusted Root and Server certificate into the Local Computer / Computer Account snap-in section in their appropriate areas:
Server > Personal
Trusted Root > Trusted Root Certification Authorities
Note:​ Ensure that you mark the certificates as exportable
Note: If there are certificates which have already been generated (e.g. issued to newserver.company.com issued by newserver.company.com), then delete those
Once the installation has finished, start the Qlik Sense Repository Database
Restore the backed up copy of the database
Sample command: ""C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin\pg_restore.exe"" -h localhost -p 4432 -U postgres -d QSR ""c:\backup\QSR_backup.tar""
If using a different share path for the Qlik Sense content
Copy all subfolders from the UNC root specified in the Service Cluster Section in the QMC on the old server into a newly configured UNC path for the new server
Open QlikSenseUtil
Default path C:\Program Files\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Util\QlikSenseUtil\QlikSenseUtil.exe
Click Connect to database
Enter superuser credentials
Click OK
Go to the Service cluster section
Click OK to get the current values
Make the appropriate edits
Click Save
To validate that the changes have been recorded:
Click Clear
Click OK
To launch Qlik Sense with the new hostname:
Open cmd.exe with administrative rights
Change the directory to the Repository install path
Default path C:\""Program Files""\Qlik\Sense\Repository
Execute the following command: Repository.exe  -bootstrap -standalone -restorehostname
Allow the Repository.exe to run for a while
Key log elements in C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Log\Repository\Trace\ > System_Repository
Since no other services are running, a successful result from this restore command is the Repository to fully initialize but be unable to connect to the other services
End the Repository.exe process in Task Manager
Start all Qlik Sense services
Access the QMC and/or Hub to confirm that all previous working functionality is present",,,,,,,,,

"Data integration","Advanced Analytics (R & Python) Integration","!comment Advanced analytics integration will allow users to leverage the power of external analytics engines and machine learning algorithms, such as R, Python, Matlab, Spark, etc, directly from Qlik Sense.  Server-side extension APIs will provide direct integration between the Qlik engine and third party tools, with data being exchanged as the user performs analysis. This capability will leverage the power of Qlik’s Associative Engine to only pass relevant data based on user selected context, minimizing processing times and providing the most useful insights.  Integration with Qlik Sense expression syntax and the Qlik Sense library will also be supported.

For R and Python, we plan to offer open source extensions, which will be supported by the community.  This matches how R and Python themselves are supported (these are both open source tools).  We expect the community to enhance these connectors and contribute other extensions as open source projects for additional integrations.

Advanced analytics integration will support a number of advanced analytics use cases for organizations, including fraud detection, sales forecasting, inventory optimization, market basket analysis, pricing optimization, credit risk analysis, churn analysis, and many more.

"Other","Big data - On demand app generation ( ODAG )","On-Demand App Generation allows users to intuitively analyze Big Data by generating new Qlik Sense apps on the fly, with different combinations of big data.  Users are presented with a template app that represents a summarized view of their entire big data environment, through which they can select subsets of information and generate new analysis apps dynamically.  The analysis apps provide subsets of the big data set and offer fully unrestricted search and exploration.

This approach allows users to easily define a relevant, usable view of Big Data and then explore it without boundaries or restrictions.  It was developed in conjunction with several of our customers working with Big Data.
