"Architecture","Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement","# Embed",,,,,,,,
"Architecture","Your platform integrated with Qlik Cloud using the data gateway - data movement","As for the Embedded Analytics part, we basically offer two different types of embedding strategies, the embedding via Iframe and the embedding using one of the available JS libraries. Let's see them in details in the next sections.

## IFRAME INTEGRATION
The simplest and by far the most common method of embedding into your solutions analytics built in Qlik Sense SaaS is certainly through the use of an Iframe. An Iframe is generally used to show the content of a web resource, in our case Qlik Sense, within a frame of a web page/main portal.

## JAVASCRIPT INTEGRATION
As you already know from the Introduction section, Qlik Solutions are based on standard web-technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript and that makes life easier when dealing with integration scenarios. If we add to this the fact that Qlik provides developers with a complete set of Javascript APIs to connect to the Qlik engine, retrieve a previously created app, retrieve its objects (Charts, Filters, etc...) and render them within a web-based solution, we can say that the integration experience that you have using the Javascript libraries is 360 degrees integration which allows a bi-directional communication between the information and objects contained in your web portal with the information and visualization objects contained in the Qlik apps. You can use it when you typically have an existing portal/web-page and you want to embed Qlik into it. Not only that, with the JS APIs is possible to interact with the Qlik engine by applying selections rather than actions coming from the web components of the html page external to the Qlik Sense server itself. Let's think for example about a button rather than a dropdown menu natively present within your portal. When the user makes a selection of an item from the dropdown menu, you could trigger a call to the Qlik engine that applies a data selection in the application based on the value selected by the user.

In fact, Qlik APIs first approach allows many different level of integration. You can use APIs to extract information from the app data model to represent them within native objects of your solution or, viceversa by interacting with the native components of your solution you can trigger actions on the Qlik associative engine like for example applying a filter on the data that recalculates the Qlik charts in real time once you click on a dropdown menu, rather than a reset of the filters applied so far to the app.",,,,,,,,

-  multiple on premise databases, 
- multiple Qlik Sense SaaS tenants (one for each your customers)
- the data per customer/tenant is not that big for an analytics app.
- you want almost real time data refreshes for the analytics apps without impacting the source database (CPU/Memory usage)",,,,,,,,

- the embedding of content
- the automatic provisioning using the APIs
- the data replication to the cloud

Your APIs connect to the Qlik Cloud. You setup the security first, next you copy the template apps from the source tenant to each of your customer tenants. Each app tries to reload from the S3 connection. So you only need to change the S3 connection once for each tenant.   Each Qlik Sense cloud tenant has access to on premise data via the Qlik Data Gateway - Data Movement. The data inside the buckets is being refreshed by a continious data replication process using change data capture (CDC) technology. ",,,,,,,,
